            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS the late <hi>Revolution</hi> that has given birth to this new Piece of Work; a New Face of Things required a <hi>New State of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And of all the Changes this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has gone through, as this was the moſt ſudden, ſo it is the moſt wonderfull. To ſee Popery in ſo few days crowing upon the Throne and groaning under its Ruins, but t'other day upon the Pinnacle and now ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with its ſudden Fall, is ſuch a Change as may deſerve the Admiration of this and future Ages. In ſhort, ſuch is our preſent Settlement, upon Their Majeſties happy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown, that the Popiſh Party may aſſoon ſee a Proteſtant Pope of Rome as a Popiſh King of England.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49236:4"/>
            <p>Now, to make this Work the more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uſefull to the Publick, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it into three ſeveral Parts. In the <hi>Firſt</hi> you have a particular Deſcription of <hi>EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLAND</hi> in its ſeveral Counties; of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very County-Town, with the Diſtance, and the common Road to it, from <hi>London</hi> the Metropolis; and of all other Places of note in each County. Here you have particularly a Liſt of the Market-Towns in every Shire, with the Days pointed when their Markets are kept; alſo, an account of moſt other Remarkable Things, either of Nature or Art. Beſides the Honours, or Noblemens Titles, from Counties, Cities, Towns, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Number of Men each City, or Borough, ſends to ſerve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I conclude this Part with a particular Deſcription of <hi>London, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idge. London</hi> as the Capital City of England, the Seat of its Monarchs, and the Center of Trade. <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as being the two famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of the Land, and the glorious Seats of the Muſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Part</hi> treats of the <hi>INHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BITANTS</hi> of England; their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
<pb facs="tcp:49236:4"/>Temper, Genius, Language, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the Engliſh Way of Living, Commerce, Laws, Religion, and Government. Of the King of England, and the Royal Family; particularly of the preſent King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> with a brief Relation of their Acceſſion to the Crown, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of the Diſaffected Party under their Government. Of Their Majeſties Court, Forces, and Revenues. Of the Queen Dowager, the Prince, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Denmark. Of the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Commonalty. Of the Epiſcopal, Dignify'd, and Inferiour Clergy. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Women, Children, and Servants. All of them with their reſpective Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt Part</hi> is about the <hi>COURTS</hi> of <hi>JUDICATURE.</hi> Viz. The High Court of Parliament, with a large Account of their Proceedings, Orders, Debates, Paſſing of Bills and Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the Privy-Council, and there particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Principal Secretaries of State. Of the Chancery, Kings-Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, Dutchy of Lancaſter, and all
<pb facs="tcp:49236:5"/>other Courts. To which is annexed a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the chief Perſons of the Realm both in Church and State, Magiſtrates, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Civil and Military. Who being ſubject to Change, though the Offices continue the ſame, I thought it improper to mix Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties together. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I choſe rather to place the Officers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelves, as I have done here, than to have them diſperſed where I ſpeak of their Offices. And from this Method you will reap this Conveniency, that, by Interleaving of the Catalogue only, you may fill up Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as they become void.</p>
            <p>Thus you have (as it were) a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the whole Drift of this Book. The Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is that Ingenious Piece <hi>De Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica Anglorum,</hi> written in Latin by <hi>Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith,</hi> Improved as you ſee, and fitted to the preſent Times. The Matter of it ſelf, is of a general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe both for Engliſh and Foreiners; and the Variety ſo great, that it cannot but be Pleaſant and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefull to the Reader.</p>

                     <p>At this time 'tis principally divided into three Parts, <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> the firſt two being two diſtinct Kingdoms, the laſt a Principality, but all of them happily united under one Head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ENGLAND</hi> takes up the South Parts of the Iſland, being parted from <hi>Scotland</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the River <hi>Tweede;</hi> from <hi>Wales</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in part by the River <hi>Dee;</hi> and from the reſt of the World, by the <hi>Ocean.</hi> Thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in Length, from North to South, as from <hi>Barwick</hi> to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> 320 miles; and in breadth, from Eaſt to Weſt, as from <hi>Dover</hi> to the Lands End, 270.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch is the Variety of its Breadth, that in the South Parts, which face the Channel, 'tis three times the Breadth of the North. And all along the Sea-Coaſt in general there are ſo many Creeks and Inlets, ſome greater and ſome leſſer, that <hi>England</hi> (and indeed the whole Iſland) delineated as it is in Globes and Maps, makes but an odd kind of Figure. However in this Spot of Ground, not exceeding one third Part of <hi>France,</hi> there are reckoned 30 millions of Acres.</p>
                     <p>In reference to the Globe, it lies between the 50, and 57 Degree of North Latitude; the longeſt Day in the moſt Northern Parts being 17 hours, 30 minutes; and the ſhorteſt in the moſt Southern, almoſt eight hours long.</p>
                     <p>The name of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> it took from the <hi>Angles,</hi> an ancient People of <hi>Jutland</hi> in <hi>Denmark;</hi> who, joyning with their Neighbours the <hi>Saxons,</hi> went under their Name in the Conqueſt of <hi>Britain.</hi> And this Name was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49236:21"/>given it by a ſpecial Edict of <hi>Egbert,</hi> the firſt ſole Monarch of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49236:24"/>Richneſs of its <hi>Soil,</hi> the happy temper of its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,</hi> or the Bleſſed Conſtitution of its <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> eſpecially under their preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties.</p>
                     <p>As it is in a manner ſurrounded by the <hi>Sea,</hi> it injoys Two great <hi>Advantages,</hi> the One in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to foreign <hi>Trade,</hi> and the Other in point of Security from forein <hi>Invaſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In relation to forein <hi>Trade,</hi> it lies open to all Parts of the World that are adjacent to the Sea, either for the Exportation of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or the Importation of foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. To which purpoſe, as Nature has fenced its Sea-Coaſts from the Irruptions and Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sea with high <hi>Cliffs,</hi> ſo ſhe has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it with abundance of ſafe and capacious <hi>Harbours</hi> for the ſecurity of Ships.</p>
                     <p>As for a forein <hi>Invaſion,</hi> 'tis certain, that Iſlands of any great Importance, are by Nature the moſt defenſible Places, and the leaſt open to Conqueſts. The Sea, that fluid Element which ſurrounds them, is ſuch a Bar to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Attempts; the Winds that govern it, ſo fickle and uncertain; the Charges of a Fleet and Land Army ſo vaſt; the Preparations ſuch as cannot be carried on with that ſpeed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy as for an Invaſion by Land; and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Landing ſo great, in caſe of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true no Continent perhaps was oftener Conquered than <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> firſt by the <hi>Romans,</hi> then by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> afterwards by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and laſt of all by the <hi>Normans.</hi> But how was it done? always by the help of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, or corrupted Party in the Iſland. Thus <hi>Bericus,</hi> a noble (but diſguſted) <hi>Britain,</hi> incouraged <hi>Claudius</hi> the Roman Emperour, to ſtretch his Empire hither. And <hi>Vortiger</hi> an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49236:24"/>of the Britiſh Throne, called in the Saxons to his help; who, having got a footing here, could not be ſo eaſily expelled as brought in. In ſhort, it may be ſaid, England was never, and can ſcarce be Conquered but by England; eſpecially ſince its happy Conjunction with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Annexion of <hi>Wales.</hi> As to the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> 'tis ſelf evident, that the chief Part of the Nation had a hand in it; and as it proved, we may juſtly call it, not an Invaſion, (as King <hi>James</hi> affected to do,) but a wonderful and ſignal Deliverance.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe Two great Advantages of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> which England does injoy from its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation near the Sea, let us add the Proſpect it has from the Sea-Coaſt of the wonderful <hi>Ocean,</hi> one of the three great Antiquities of the World; and the plentiful Variety of Fiſh, and Sea-Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it affords to this Iſland.</p>
                     <p>But that which raiſes my Admiration of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of it, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a flat and open Country, not overgrown with wild and unwholſom Foreſts, nor dreadful high Mountains. What <hi>Hills</hi> it has are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very gentle and pleaſant, and raiſed as it were to give a charming Proſpect to the Eye; as its <hi>Foreſts</hi> ſeem only contrived for Variety, and the pleaſure of Hunting.</p>
                     <p>But one Thing there is, which adds much to the Beauty of it, and that is its excellent <hi>Verdure.</hi> Which by reaſon of the mildneſs of the Air, even in the Winter-Seaſon, exceeds in dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time the moſt fruitful Places of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which add the Concourſe of ſo many <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> which glide through this Country, and ſtrive to make it agreeable and fruitful.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Thames</hi> is a Compound of the <hi>Thame</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> two Rivers, the firſt whereof riſes in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> the other near <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> in <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> both joyning together into one Stream by Dorceſter in Oxfordſhire, where it parts that County from Barkſhire. From whence taking its courſe Eaſtward, with many Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Turnings, it parts <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> from <hi>Barkſhire, Middleſex</hi> from <hi>Surrey,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> from <hi>Kent.</hi> Where being ſwelled with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of ſeveral leſſer Rivers, it diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea; watering by the way, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Towns, <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Windſor</hi> in Barkſhire, <hi>Kingſton</hi> and <hi>Southwark</hi> in <hi>Surrey, London</hi> in Middleſex, <hi>Barking</hi> in Eſſex, and <hi>Graveſend</hi> in Kent. A River the Water whereof is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wholſom, the Stream exceeding gentle, and the Tides very commodious for Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Sea flows gently up this River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 80 Miles, almoſt as far as <hi>Kingſton,</hi> being 12 Miles by Land, and 20 by Water, above London.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Medway</hi> is a Kentiſh River, not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the length of its Courſe, as for the Depth of its Channel; and therefore made uſe of for harbouring the Royal Navy. It runs thorough <hi>Maidſtone, Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Chatham,</hi> a few Miles from whence it empties it ſelf in the Mouth of the <hi>Thames.</hi> This River loſes it ſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49236:25"/>under Ground, and riſes again at <hi>Looſe,</hi> not far from <hi>Cox-Heath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Severn</hi> riſes in <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> a County of North-Wales. From whence it runs through <hi>Shropſhire, Worceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> where it does ſo expatiate it ſelf, that the Mouth of it is more like an Arm of the Sea, than any part of a River. It waters in its courſe <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the chief Towns of the foreſaid three Counties; and takes in by the way ſeveral Rivers of good note, two <hi>Avons,</hi> the <hi>Temd,</hi> the <hi>Wye,</hi> and the <hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Ouſe</hi> has its ſource in the South-Borders of <hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi> From whence it runs through the Counties of <hi>Bucks, Bedford, Huntington, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where it diſcharges it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ocean; watering in its Courſe <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Bedford, Huntington, Ely,</hi> and the Sea-Port of <hi>Lyn</hi> in Norfolk. The River that runs through York, has alſo the Name of <hi>Ouſe,</hi> being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound chiefly of theſe three Yorkſhire Rivers, the <hi>Swale,</hi> the <hi>Youre,</hi> and the <hi>Warfe.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> you will find the little <hi>Ouſe,</hi> which parting theſe Two Counties, runs at laſt into the great <hi>Ouſe.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Trent,</hi> which divides England into Two Parts, North and South, has its Riſe in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire;</hi> and from thence runs through <hi>Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Humber</hi> not far from <hi>Hull.</hi> It wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in its courſe theſe three chief Places, <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Newark,</hi> and <hi>Gainsborough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Humber</hi> is a Yorkſhire River, if that can be called a diſtinct River which has no Spring of its own, but is more properly a Compound (or rather a Mouth) of ſeveral Rivers joyning into one Stream, eſpecially the <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>York Ouſe,</hi> the <hi>Dun,</hi> and the <hi>Darewent.</hi> The Town of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49236:26"/>
                        <hi>Hull</hi> is ſeated upon it, before which Place it widens it ſelf (much like the <hi>Severn</hi> at its Mouth) to a great breadth, and ſo falls into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tees</hi> is another River of the North, parting <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> from the <hi>Biſhoprick of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and running from Weſt to Eaſt into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tine,</hi> famous for its Coal-trade, parts for ſome Miles <hi>Durham</hi> from <hi>Northumberland,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning likewiſe from Weſt to Eaſt Seaward, by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> therefore called <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Twede</hi> is the furtheſt River Northward, and that which parts <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Scotland.</hi> At the Influx whereof into the Sea is ſeated <hi>Barwick,</hi> called from this River <hi>Barwick upon Twede.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, beſides theſe principal Rivers, and many others of leſs note, though ſeveral of them Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable, I cannot but mention thoſe pleaſant <hi>Rivulets</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> which are ſo numerous in this Country.

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the</hi> Air <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND. <hi>Its Temperateneſs, and the Effects of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the Situation of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> ſo far North as it is, one would think the <hi>Air</hi> ſhould be pretty ſharp here, and at leaſt colder than in France, which lies South from it. Whereas it is ſo Temperate, Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that the Winters are milder here, and the Summers much more moderate.</p>
                     <p>In Winter-time the warm Vapours of the Sea on every ſide do ſo thicken the <hi>Air,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſoon penetrate as the thin Air of hot Countries. In Summer the frequent Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Clouds, often diſſolving into Rain, and the uſual Blaſts from the Sea, allay thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heats, which both hot and cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates are troubled with in that Seaſon, for want of Wind and Rain.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>ENGLAND</hi> has the happineſs of being ſeldom tired, either with a long <hi>Froſt</hi> in Winter, or <hi>Drought</hi> in Summer. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, while Continents in the ſame Latitude, and ſome of a much more Southern Situation, ly under Snow, pinched with a hard Froſt, it happens often that our Fields are here cloathed with Graſs, as in the Spring. And whilſt the Sun in Summer ſcorches the Plants, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants themſelves of hot Climates, here it ſhines ſo kindly, that it does but warm us by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49236:27"/>a moderate Heat, which makes the Country ſo plentiful both of Corn and Paſture.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, on the other ſide, the Air is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pure, nor the Weather ſo ſerene, or regular, as it is in Continents. Moſt part of the Winter <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is under a Cloud, often ſtuffed up with Fogs, troubled with rainy Weather, and (except there happens a Froſt) but ſeldom injoying the Sun in its ſplendour. Whence proceed thoſe frequent <hi>Colds,</hi> which are in a manner the original Cauſe of moſt of our Diſtempers; and from the frequency of Rain, <hi>Land-floods,</hi> which drown the Countries where the Rivers ſwell out of their Channels, and break over their Banks.</p>
                     <p>And yet, as rainy as this Country is, we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſee here ſuch impetuous Showers (or rather Storms) of Rain, as hot Countries are ſubject to, which often drown the faireſt Hopes of the Husbandman. For, if they have Rain but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they have it by the great, and ſometimes with a Vengeance. Whereas in England, where it is more frequent, it proves moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a gentle ſoaking Rain.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Inconveniency in the Weather here, and that is its <hi>Changeableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Irregularity,</hi> according to the Wind that blows. Which happens ſometimes to be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſudden, that in the ſpace of 24 hours I have obſerved four different ſorts of Weather, proper enough for the four Seaſons of the Year. This I confeſs, is an extraordinary Caſe. But however ſuch is the Mutableneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it ſeldom holds out many Days in the ſame degree, either of Warmth, Coldneſs, or Drineſs. And of all Times of the Year, the Month of March is the moſt ſubject to Change, witneſs the uſual Expreſſion, <hi>March Many-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49236:27"/>
                     <p>And yet this may be ſaid for Changeableneſs of Weather, that it creates Diverſion by its Variety. What is more comfortable in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a warm Day after a fit of cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a cool Day in Summer, after a fit of hot Weather? The quickeſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Pleaſures grow dull by their Continuance, but Change ſets an edge upon 'em. And, as glorious as the Sun appears in its greateſt ſplendour, I have oftentimes been weary of its undiſcontinued Appearance for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is nothing near ſo ſubject to <hi>Hail,</hi> to <hi>Thunder,</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> or to the Heavens darting of <hi>Thunderbolts,</hi> as many other Regions, which are frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with thoſe dreadful Meteors.</p>
                     <p>And, if Nature be ſomewhat too prodigal of Moiſture in this Country, ſhe is on the other ſide as careful to cure it. Scarce a fit of Rain is over, but comes a fit of <hi>Wind</hi> to dry up the Moiſture, and purify the Air. So that the moſt part of the Year is commonly divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Gods of the Heathens, <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Aeolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Wind that reigns moſt in <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is the <hi>Weſterly Wind,</hi> which blows from the vaſt Weſtern Ocean perhaps three parts in four of the Year. But when I ſay a Weſterly Wind, I don't mean only that which blows directly from the Cardinal Point, but all the Collateral Points from South to North.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Eaſterly Wind,</hi> eſpecially in the Spring, is lookt upon here to be fatal to Plants; and if the Proverb be true, to Man and Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>high Winds,</hi> and <hi>tempeſtuous Weather,</hi> we have here two Times of the Year, ſeldom free from it. And thoſe are the two Equinoxes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49236:28"/>in September and March. But for <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> England of all the Countries in Europe, is the leaſt ſubject to 'em. The Storm indeed which hapned on the 12th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary laſt, was ſo very violent, blew with ſuch impetuous Guſts, and proved ſo miſchievous, that it may paſs for an Hurricane. But it was ſuch as the like has not been known here within the Memory of Man.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, whatever be the Diſadvantages of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> in point of <hi>Air,</hi> in reſpect to other Countries, the ſame is ſufficiently coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailed by the Sweetneſs and Comforts of it, as 'twill further appear by the inſuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <p>'TIS ſaid of Henry the Seventh, one of the wiſeſt Kings that ever ſat upon the Throne of England, but whoſe Breeding had been low and private, That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once preſſed by ſome of his Council to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his Title to France, he returned this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; 'Tis true, ſays he, France <hi>is a noble and gallant Kingdom, but</hi> England <hi>in my mind is as fine a Seat for a Country Gentleman as any is in Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I paſs by the Reflection; and taking his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in a plain literal Senſe, I own, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49236:28"/>is, in moſt Things, one of the fineſt and beſt Countries in Europe. I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated wherein its Beauty conſiſts, and now the Subject of this Chapter ſhall be its Plentifulneſs.</p>
                     <p>And firſt for <hi>Corn,</hi> either for Man or Beaſt, it may cerainly outvy moſt Countries in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; As it may for <hi>Pasture,</hi> which makes the Cattel thrive here exceedingly. And, though here be many Heaths, yet they are not ſo barren, but that they afford wherewithall to feed a World of Sheep.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>ENGLAND</hi> yields, not only Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Corn,</hi> to make Bread and Drink with, &amp;c. but alſo abundance of all manner of <hi>Cattle,</hi> for wholeſom ſubſtantial Food; with plenty of <hi>Salt, Cheeſe,</hi> and <hi>Butter.</hi> For Dainties and Variety, 'tis ſtocked with <hi>Fallow Deer,</hi> beyond any part of Europe. <hi>Hares</hi> and <hi>Conies,</hi> tame and wild <hi>Fowl,</hi> eatable <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Herbs, Fruits</hi> of moſt ſorts it has abundance of.

                     <p>I come now to thoſe inexhauſtible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Coals, Lead, Copper, Tin,</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> which are dug out of the Bowels of the Earth in this Kingdom. The <hi>Coal-mines</hi> do chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich Newcaſtle in Northumberland, from whence a great part of the Kingdom is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Coals for Fewel; without which it could not poſſibly ſubſiſt, ſo great is the Decay of Woods, and the Neglect of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lead-Mines</hi> are moſt conſiderable in the Peak of Derbyſhire; and thoſe of <hi>Tin</hi> in Cornwal, where they dig Tin not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Silver in fineneſs. Here are alſo <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Mines,</hi> but herein Cumberland does exceed it. As for the <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> 'tis true they bring more Damage to the Publick by the Spoil of Woods, than the Profit that accrues thereby to private Perſons amounts to.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo <hi>Silver-Mines,</hi> as in <hi>Cornwal, Lancaſhire,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> richer than the very Mines of Potoſi, in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49236:30"/>whence the King of Spain has moſt of his Silver. For, whereas theſe yield uſually but one Ounce and a half of Silver in one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ounces of Oar, our Engliſh Mines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly yield ſix or eight Ounces per Cent. 'Tis true ours lying deeper, and harder to come unto, and the Workmen being dear (which is otherwiſe in <hi>Potoſi,</hi>) all theſe things concurring together, are like to ſecure them from any further Attempt.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, though ſome Countries excel <hi>ENGLAND</hi> in ſome Things, yet this may be ſaid of it in general; That there is ſcarce any Country, whoſe Fields are better ſtored with all ſort of <hi>Corn;</hi> the Paſtures, with <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;</hi> the Woods, and Forreſts, Parks, and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, with <hi>wild Beaſts,</hi> only for Recreation and Food; the Air with <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Fowls;</hi> the Seas and Rivers, with <hi>Fiſhes;</hi> and the Mines with <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Metals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, there is ſcarce a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo little troubled with <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>ravenous Beasts,</hi> with <hi>venomous Serpents,</hi> or noiſom <hi>Flies</hi> and <hi>Vermine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wolves,</hi> which of all ravenous Beaſts are the moſt pernicious and deſtructive of Cattel, have been ſo wonderfully extirpated out of this Land, that I cannot omit the Hiſtory of it. I know it has been a Tradition of old Writers, that <hi>England</hi> never had any <hi>Wolves</hi> at all, and that being brought hither from other Places, they would not live. But Hiſtory tells us the contrary, here being abundance of them, till King <hi>Edgar</hi> commuted for 300 Wolves the yearly Tribute paid him by the Prince of Wales. Which made the Welch ſo induſtrious and active in Wolf-hunting, that the Wolves were in time quite rooted out of the Land,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49236:31"/>the Welch proteſting at laſt, they could find no more of 'em.</p>
                     <p>Whereby 'tis come to paſs, that whereas in other Countries they are at the Charge and Trouble of guarding their Sheep, and houſing them by night, here they are left feeding in the Fields day and night, ſecure from any Danger, unleſs it be ſometimes from <hi>Men-Wolves,</hi> or Sheep-ſtealers.</p>
                     <p>And yet I am credibly informed, that in ſome Places, as Warwickſhire among the reſt, ſome Wolves from time to time have been diſcovered. But, as it happens but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo upon the leaſt notice the Country riſes amain, as it were againſt a common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; there being ſuch a hue and cry after the Wolf, that it is hard for him to eſcape the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus.</hi>

And, as it lies in the Way from London to the North-Weſt Parts of England, it is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with Inns for Travellers. This is the Way called <hi>Wailing-ſtreet,</hi> being a Military High-Way of the Romans, which croſſed all the Country. At this Place King Edward the Elder obſtructed the Paſſage of the Danes, whilſt he fortified Towceſter againſt them. And here King Edward Lerected a beautiful Croſs, in Memorial of his Queen Eleanor, whoſe Corps reſted here in her Journey from Lincolnſhire where ſhe died, to Weſtminſter Abbey, the Place of her Sepulture.</p>

                        <p>It extends it ſelf in <hi>Length,</hi> from North to South, 35 miles; in <hi>Breadth,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, 20. The Whole divided into 17 <hi>Hundreds,</hi> 163 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 8 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis for the moſt part a pleaſant, fruitful, Champain Country, abounding in all Things neceſſary, ſtored with Meadows and Paſtures, plentiful of Corn and Barley, and abundantly furniſhed with Fiſh and Fowl.

                        <p>At <hi>Congleton,</hi> they make great ſtore of Points, Purſes, and leather Gloves. <hi>Sandbich</hi> is only famous for its Ale, ſold at London for 12 pence the bottle; which, for ſtrength and clearneſs, does equalize Canary. <hi>Maxfield,</hi> or <hi>Maclesfield,</hi> is a large and fair Town, which drives a great Trade of Buttons. But it is of moſt note for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Charles Gerard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Maclesfield,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This County (formerly a Part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and its Inhabitants part of the <hi>Cornavii,</hi> as the Romans called them) is now in the Dioceſe of <hi>Chester.</hi>

                        <p>The Earls hereof were anciently accounted Palatines; ſince William the Conquerour gave this Earldom to <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> a noble Norman, <hi>to be holden as freely by his Sword, as the King himſelf held England by his Crown;</hi> which was the Tenure of all Counts Palatine, more like Princes than Subjects. And, though it be now, (and has long been) reannexed to the Crown; yet it ſtill holds the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a County Palatine; having, for the adminiſtration thereof, a Chamberlain, a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the Common-Pleas of the Crown, two Barons of the Exchequer, a Sheriff, an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheator, and other Officers, to the great eaſe of all the Country, in expedition of their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>Out of it are elected, beſides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members of Parliament, and <hi>Cheſter</hi> only has the Right of Election.</p>

                           <hi>CORNWAL,</hi> the furtheſt County in the Weſt of England, is on all ſides ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sea; except Eaſtward, where the River <hi>Tamer</hi> parts it from Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Length</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt is about 70. miles; and the <hi>broadeſt Part,</hi> next to Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, 40. The Whole divided into nine <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,</hi> wherein 161 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 21 <hi>Market Towns.</hi>

                        <p>The Country being for the moſt part but narrow, you cannot expect here Rivers of any long Courſe. The <hi>Tamer</hi> aforeſaid is the moſt conſiderable; next to which you have the <hi>Camel,</hi> and the <hi>Fale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here the Air is pure and ſubtile, but much ſubject to Winds and ſtormy Weather; and more apt to preſerve than to recover Health, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Strangers.</p>

                        <p>The Country in general is hilly, and rocky, the Rocks being cruſted over with a ſhallow Earth. The Parts towards the Sea are the moſt fruitful both in Corn and Paſturage. Which happens partly by the induſtrious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring the Ground with a fruitful ſort of Sand, and a Sea-weed called Orewood. The middle Parts, except the Incloſures about Towns and Villages, ly generally waſte and open, and ſerve chiefly for Summer Cattel. But, as to Game, both for the Hawk and the Hound, here's great ſtore of it.</p>
                        <p>One Thing it excels all other Counties in, and that is its Tin Mines, the Tin whereof goes beyond any in Europe for fineneſs.</p>
                        <p>Here is alſo found in ſome Rocks a ſort of precious Stone, called the Corniſh Diamond, ſhaped and poliſhed by Nature; and ſome of them as big as a Walnut, but indeed not ſo hard as the right Diamond.</p>

                        <p>In Mounts Bay is the famous Hill, called <hi>S. Michael's Mount,</hi> ſevered from the main Land by a ſandy Plain, which at Ebb-water may be paſſed over on foot.

                        <p>The Haven before it is ſo ſafe and ſo capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Town has thriven of late very much upon it; the Creeks being coaſted with ſteep Shores, and ſo large withal, that 100 Sail of Ships may ſafely ride at Anchor.

                        <p>For <hi>Fewel,</hi> it is not beholden to Wood, the Woods having been deſtroyed in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the Countries Iron-Works, Lead-mines, and Coal-Delfs.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49236:47"/>the Peak of Derbyſhire, as well as for its Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but particularly for its three wonderful Caves.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Peak</hi> ly's amongſt the Mountains, in the North-Weſt Parts; and its three Caves, of a wonderful vaſt height, length, and depth, are known by the Names of <hi>Devils Arſe, Elden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,</hi> and <hi>Pools hole.</hi> From the <hi>Devils Arſe</hi> a Water comes, which is ſaid to ebb and flow 4 times in an hour, (as the Well in the Peak Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) and to keep its juſt Tides.

                        <p>This Town is ſeated upon the Weſt Bank of <hi>Derwent</hi> (from whence probably the Name of <hi>Derby</hi> is extracted) over which there is a fine Bridge of free Stone, and upon the Bridge a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel called St. Maries Chappel.

                        <p>'Tis a large, populous, and rich Place, few inland Towns equalizing it. Here are five Pariſh Churches, of which that of All-Saints is the faireſt. Whoſe Tower-Steeple (in which are 8 tunable Bells) built at the only Charge of the young Men and Maids about the Reign of Q. Mary, is equalled for height and beauty by few in the Nation. Here is alſo a fair Hall, built not many years ſince of free Stone at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Charge, where the Aſſizes are conſtantly kept.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, 'tis a Place of good Trade and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, no leſs famous for good Ale than Banbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for its Cakes and Cheeſe. Here is chiefly a

Its Market is on Fridays, which is very great for Cattel, Corn, and all Proviſions; beſides ſmall Markets on Wedneſdays, and Saturdays.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this Town is dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, now in the perſon of the Right Honourable <hi>William Stanley,</hi> Earl of Derby, and Lord of the Iſle of Man.

                        <p>Among which <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth</hi> are two noted Harbours in the Channel, but the firſt eſpecially. Seated between the <hi>Tamer</hi> and the <hi>Plime,</hi> at both their falls into the Sea; the <hi>Plime</hi> being but a ſmall River, from whence <hi>Plimouth</hi> however has took its Denomination. 'Tis one of the beſt Ports in England, having a ſafe and commodious Haven, ſtrongly fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides. A Place of great importance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49236:51"/>to the Kingdom, not only for his Majeſty's, but for Merchants Ships outward or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound, to anchor in, upon any Caſualty. The Conveniency whereof has ſo improved this Town, from a poor fiſhing Village, that it is now grown up to Statelineſs. Laſtly, this Place is dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, now in the perſon of the Right Honourable <hi>Other Windſor,</hi> Earl of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> &amp;c. Derived to him from his Grandfather <hi>Thomas,</hi> Created Earl of <hi>Plimouth</hi> by King Charles II. But the firſt that injoy'd this Title was <hi>Charles Fitz Charles,</hi> commonly called <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> created Baron of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Totnes,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> Anno 1675. who ſoon after died at Tangier.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> ſo called from its Situation at the Mouth of the River <hi>Dart,</hi> is alſo a good Port Town, having a commodious Haven, well fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and traded unto. There's in it three Pariſh Churches. And it gives the Title of Baron to the Right Honourable <hi>George Leg,</hi> made Baron of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> by King Charles II.</p>
                        <p>Few miles from <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> to the North-Eaſt, is the Bay called <hi>Torbay,</hi> of chief note for the Deſcent here made by his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Land-Forces from Holland, upon the fifth of Nov. (being Gun-powder Treaſon Day) 1688.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Torbay</hi> to the Coaſt of Dorſetſhire, there is not a Sea-Town of any note, but <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> Which indeed was a good Port Town, as well as <hi>Seaton</hi> and <hi>Budley</hi> near adjoyning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Havens were choaked up with Sands. Now 'tis but a ſmall Fiſher-Town.</p>
                        <p>On the North Coaſt you will find <hi>Combe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merton, Ilfarcomb,</hi> and <hi>Hartland,</hi> all of them but mean Towns.</p>

                        <p>Further Weſtward you will find <hi>Bediford, Torrington,</hi> and <hi>Hatherley,</hi> all three on the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge.</hi> Over which River <hi>Bediford</hi> has a large Stone-bridge of arched Work, conſiſting of 24 Peers; and ſo high, that a Veſſel of 50 or 60 Tuns may paſs under it. Which Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation has made it a Place of good account and trade. <hi>Torrington,</hi> a pretty large Town, is chiefly noted, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <hi>Arthur Herbert,</hi> lately created Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> by our preſent King, and made Lord Admiral of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Fleet. Whereas this Title was before in the Perſon of the Duke of Albemarle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</p>

Honoured once with the Title of an Earldom, in the perſon of <hi>George,</hi> Lord <hi>Carew</hi> of <hi>Clopton,</hi> Created Earl of <hi>Totneſs</hi> by King Charles I. Anno 1625. He was Son of <hi>George Carew,</hi> Dr. of Divinity, Arch-Deacon of <hi>Totneſs,</hi> and afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Deanry of <hi>Windſor.</hi> But, dying without Iſſue male, the Title died with him.

                        <p>This County is ſo well watered, what with the Sea, and what with the Rivers, that it is almoſt incompaſſed with Water. Next to the River <hi>Tine</hi> which parts it for ſome miles from Northumberland, and the <hi>Tees</hi> from Yorkſhire, here is the <hi>Ware</hi> which runs through <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Derwent</hi> into the Tine.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Soil</hi> of it is different, ſo it is in ſome Parts fertile, in others barren, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly inhabited.

                        <p>The greateſt Ornament of this Place is the Caſtle, and the Cathedral.

Over againſt it, on the ſame Hill, ſtands the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, whoſe Structure has this Defect, that it is built of a ſoft mouldering Stone. Between both theſe is a ſpacious Place, called the Green. On one ſide whereof is the Hall where the Aſſizes are kept, with a handſom publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary erected and founded by Dr. <hi>Coſins,</hi> the late Biſhop of Durham; and on the other ſide, a Row of Alms-Houſes, the ſtanding Fruits of his Charity.</p>

                        <p>This County was formerly called <hi>St. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts Patrimony,</hi> from <hi>S. Cuthbert,</hi> the Raiſer of Durham; whoſe Epiſcopal See was removed hither from <hi>Lindisfarn,</hi> or Holy Iſland, on the Coaſt of Northumberland. A Saint for whom ſeveral of the Saxon Kings, and after them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi> the Dane, had ſo great a Veneration, that upon him, and his Succeſſors in that See, was all the Country between Tees and Tine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by <hi>Alfred</hi> King of England. Which his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49236:59"/>Donation was confirmed, and in part increaſed, by his Succeſſors <hi>Edward, Athelſtan,</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> the Dane. So fortified it was with Priviledges and Royal Grants, that, at the coming in of the Norman Conquerour, the Biſhop was reputed for a Count Palatine, and did ingrave upon his Seal an armed Knight, holding a naked Sword in one hand, and in the other the Biſhops Arms. Nay, it was once adjudged in Law, that the Biſhop was to have all Forfeitures and Eſcheats within the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the King had without. In ſhort, the Biſhops hereof had the Royalty of Princes, having their own Courts of Judicature both for Civil and Criminal Cauſes, and covning their own Coin. But theſe exorbitant Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities were in part impaired by a Statute under Henry VIII, and altogether with the Lands and whole Rights thereof conferred upon the Crown by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the laſt Year of the Reign of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, when England was divided into ſeven Kingdoms, this County was Part of that of Northumberland.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49236:64"/>London, but alſo a Biſhops See, and a County of it ſelf, deſerves a particular Deſcription. It is both pleaſantly and commodiouſly ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the fall of the <hi>Frome</hi> into the <hi>Avon,</hi> which five Miles from thence empties it ſelf into the Severn. By this River the City is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Parts, the chief Part in Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and the other in Somerſetſhire, but with the conveniency of Communication by means of a fair Stone Bridge. Which (like London Bridge) is ſo covered with Houſes, that it looks more like a Street than a Bridge. Its Streets are neatly ordered, and ſet out with many fine Edifices. Among which may be reckoned the Cathedral, and moſt of the Pariſh Churches, which are 18 in Number. The City is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with a Wall, beſides other Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. At the Eaſt end of it ſtood a Caſtle, wherein King Stephen was kept a Priſoner by Maud the Empreſs. But it was demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Oliver Cromwel, and is now built in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Streets, called Caſtle-ſtreet and Caſtle-Green.</p>
                        <p>But that which has chiefly made <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſo conſiderable is the goodneſs of its Port. The principal Key whereof ſtands on the <hi>Frome,</hi> which at Spring-Tides does flow about 40 Foot, and ſo brings Ships in of a great Burden. Thus <hi>Briſtol,</hi> by its Commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Shipping, is become a Place of great Reſort both for Merchants and Tradeſmen; thoſe driving a great Trade to moſt Parts of the Known World, theſe a Home-Trade, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to Wales, to Shropſhire, and other Counties.</p>
                        <p>About <hi>Briſtol</hi> is great ſtore of Coals; alſo, a ſort of Precious Stone, called from thence <hi>Briſtol-Stones,</hi> taken out of S. Vincents Rock.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49236:64"/>At the bottom whereof is a <hi>hot Well,</hi> of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal nature.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, though <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſtands partly (as I ſaid before) in this County, and partly in Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire; yet, as it is a County of it ſelf, it yields Obedience to neither. And conſidering its Beauty, Trade, Riches, Extent, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs, it may be counted the chief Place in England, next to London.</p>
                        <p>'Tis but about 150 Years ſince this Town came to he a Biſhops See, this being one of the ſix new Sees erected by Henry VIII. by virtue of an Act of Parliament made in order to it. But it is leſs ſince it became a Title of Nobility, which was not till King James I. conferred the Honour of Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Digby</hi> of <hi>Sherburn,</hi> Anno 1622. From him devolved by his Death to his Son <hi>George,</hi> in the Year 1650, and from him to the Right Hononrable <hi>John Digby,</hi> the preſent Earl of Briſtol.</p>

                           <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> commonly pronounced <hi>Circeſter,</hi> is ſeated on the River <hi>Churn,</hi> over which it has a Bridge. It has been a Place of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the time of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſiſting upon the Roman Coyns, Checker-work Pavements, and engraven Marble Stones, that have oft been digged up here, its very ruinous Walls, ſtill to be ſeen, and about 2 Miles in Circuit, are a ſufficient proof of its former Greatneſs. This City was taken from the Britains by the Weſt-Saxons, and afterwards poſſeſſed by the Mercians, till laid in Aſhes by a Stratagem of the mercileſs Danes, in tying fire to the Wings of Sparrows, from whence it came to be called the <hi>Sparrows City.</hi> Since which Deſolation, it could never recover it ſelf to any thing beyond the Name of a good Borough Town.</p>

A Town of good account for making of Woollen Cloth, and for the beſt Muſtard in the Kingdom, as <hi>Dijon</hi> is in France. But moſt of all memorable for the Battel fought here Anno 1471. between King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and his immediate Succeſſor Edward IV, that is, between the Houſe of Lancaſter and York, where the Lancaſtrians were intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated, and the young Prince Edward (the only Son of King Henry) ſlain.</p>

                        <p>Near the Severn Banks ſtands <hi>Berkley Caſtle,</hi> which gives Name to a noble and ancient Family diſperſed in many Places of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and whereof they were made Barons by King Henry the II. Whereas before that time they were called <hi>Fitz-Harding,</hi> as being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from one Robert <hi>Fitz-Harding,</hi> of the Blood-Royal of the Danes. William Lord Berkley of this Houſe deſcended from the Mowbraies (who, amongſt other Titles, were Earls of Nottingham) was in the Year 1432 created Viſcount Berkley by King Richard III; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of Nottingham, and Earl Marſhal, by King Henry VIII; and finally Marqueſs Berkley, by the ſame King Anno 1509. But dying without Iſſue, all thoſe Titles ended with him. Only the Title of Lord Berkley continued in the Collateral Line, till advanced to the Title of Earl by King Charles II.

                        <p>To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and its Inhabitants, with thoſe of Oxfordſhire, known among the ancient Romans by the Name of <hi>Dobuni</hi>) is now partly in the Dioceſe of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and partly in that of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the <hi>Venta Belgarum</hi> of the ancient Romans, is pleaſantly ſeated in a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Hills, and on the Banks of the River
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49236:67"/>Itching. A City of great Antiquity, and noted among the Romans for being the Place where the rich Imbroideries were made for their Emperours. In the time of the Saxons it was twice conſumed by fire, and by them rebuilt; being made the Royal Seat of the Weſt-Saxon Kings, and the chief Epiſcopal See. Afterwards it felt, with many other Places, the fury of the Danes. In the time of the Normans it was repaired, and honoured with the keeping of the publick Records of the Kingdom. But ſoon after it had a Relapſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſore oppreſſed during the Civil Wars of Maud the Empreſs and King Stephen. At laſt it began in the Reign of Edward III. to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf, having made it the Mart for Wool and Cloth.</p>
                        <p>At preſent this City contains, within its Walls, about a mile and a half in Circuit, but not without ſome waſte. Here is a fine Hall, where the Aſſizes and Seſſions are kept for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in this Hall hangs up <hi>King Arthur's Round Table,</hi> which is kept as a Monument.</p>
                        <p>For Divine Worſhip, here are five Pariſh Churches. Beſides the Cathedral, a large and beautiful Structure, dedicated to the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and of ſpecial note, for being the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of many Saxon Kings and Queens, beſides two Kings of the Daniſh, and two of the Norman Race. For the Education of Youth, here is in the Suburbs a fair Colledge, liberally endowed, and a place of good Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; built and endowed by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wickham</hi> for a Seminary to his other Colledge in Oxford. And for the Relief of the Poor, a very fair Hoſpital, called S. <hi>Croſles,</hi> not far off from the Colledge.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49236:67"/>called <hi>Wolveſey-Houſe;</hi> and, upon a Hill, a ſtrong Caſtle, which overlooks the Country.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, the City of Wincheſter is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well peopled, and frequented.

                           <p>The <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight</hi> falls next under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. And as Nature has parted it from the reſt, ſo in her Imitation, I give you here a ſeparate Account of it.</p>
                           <p>This Iſland, being ſcarce 3 miles from <hi>Hurſt-Caſtle,</hi> is generally ſuppoſed to have been diſmembred from Hampſhire by the Sea. 'Tis about 20 miles in length, and 12 broad where broadeſt; of an oval Form, ending with two Peninſules, one Eaſt, and the other Weſt. Naturally fenced
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49236:68"/>about with ſteep and craggy Rocks, amongſt which the <hi>Shingles</hi> and the <hi>Needles</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtward are of chief note amongſt Sea-men. Southward, where it looks towards France, it is inacceſſible; but, towards the North-Eaſt, ſomething flat and level.</p>
                           <p>The Soil hereof abundantly anſwers the Pains of the Husband man. So plentiful it is of Corn and Paſturage, that the Inhabitants have not only ſufficient for themſelves, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh alſo the Markets of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> (but the firſt eſpecially,) with the greateſt part of the Wheat, Fleſh, Cheeſe, and Butter, which is ſpent amongſt them. Inſomuch that the Souldiers of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on the ſtrength of that Town, uſe to ſay, That as long as they have the Iſle of Wight to their Friend, and the Seas open, they need not care for all the World beſides. And, as the Sea about this Iſland is exceeding full of Fiſh, ſo is the Land ſtored almoſt in all Places with Conies, Hares, Partridges, and Pheaſants. And the Sheep here yield ſo fine a Fleece, that the Wool hereof has the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that of Coteſwold in Gloceſterſhire, and is next in eſteem to that of Lemſter in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire.</p>
                           <p>This Iſland is divided into two principal Parts, <hi>viz. Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Meden;</hi> containing 36 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and in them 3 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>

'Tis a large and populous Town, having two Markets a Week, <hi>viz.</hi> Wedneſdays and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>

                           <p>In the South-Eaſt-Parts is <hi>Sandham,</hi> on a Bay ſo called, alſo fortified with a Caſtle. So that here are more Caſtles in this Spot of Ground, than there is in any the like Spot in England.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, this Iſland, as well as the Iſle of Man, has had the honour of being advanced to the Title of a Kingdom; but either of 'em much more deſervedly than the Lordſhip of <hi>Ivitot</hi> in France. 'Twas in the Year 1445, when King Henry VI, out of his particular affection to <hi>Henry Beauchamp,</hi> Earl of Warwick, crowned him King of Wight.

                           <p>Beſides this Iſland, there are to the Eaſtward of Portſmouth, two leſſer Iſles, called <hi>Haling</hi> and <hi>Thorney;</hi> and having two Towns of their Name.</p>

                        <p>Its <hi>Length,</hi> from North to South, is about 35 miles; its <hi>Breadth,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt 30. The Whole divided into 11 <hi>Hundreds,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 176 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and but 8 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This County was formerly part of Wales, before it was by Conqueſt annexed to this Crown. And then it was ſtrengthened with no leſs than 28 Caſtles, whereof there's ſcarce any thing now remaining but their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins.</p>
                        <p>Here the <hi>Air</hi> is temperate and healthful; and the <hi>Soil</hi> exceeding rich. Tis well cloathed with Wood, and refreſhed with Rivers; the principal of which are the <hi>Wye, Lug, Arrow,</hi> and <hi>Frome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Two Things this County excels in, its plenty of Fruit, and the fineſt Wool in any part of England. And, amongſt all ſorts of Fruits, the Red-ſtreak Apple (which makes the beſt ſort of Cider) is that which thrives here to admiration.</p>

                        <p>Here are three Markets a Week, viz. on Wedneſdav, Friday, and Saturday. And, in point of Trade, this Place is particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Gloves here made, and vended in great quantities in London and elſewhere.</p>

                        <p>At <hi>Kyneton,</hi> a pretty large and well-built Town, they drive a good I rade for narrow Cloths; and the Market is counted the beſt for Corn, Cattle, Proviſions, and ſeveral other Commodities, eſpecially the Wedneſdays before Chriſtmas, Eaſter, and Whitſuntide.</p>

                        <p>Among the Things remarkable in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, here is firſt, by Snod-hill Caſtle, a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of excellent Marble. And, by Richards Caſtle, in the North Part of the County, a Well called <hi>Bone-Well,</hi> wherein are always found ſinall Fiſhes Bones, but not a Fin to be ſeen. Which Well being wholly cleanſed of them, yet will the like come again, and no Man knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be produced naturally, or brought thither in Veins through the Earth.</p>
                        <p>Neither can I omit to relate the Story of <hi>Marſley Hill,</hi> tho' I could ſcarce give credit to it, were it not related both by Cambden and Speed, two Authentick Authors. This Hill, in the Year 1571, removed it ſelf with a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe from the place where it ſtood, and for 3 days together travelled from its old Seat. It began this Motion on Saturday the 7th of February about 6 a Clock at Night, and by 7 a Clock the next Morning it had gone about 200 Foot; carrying with it Sheep in their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49236:73"/>Coats, Hedge-rows, and Trees, whereof ſome ſtood, and others were overthrown. Kinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton Chappel fell down in this Remove, and two high Ways were turned about 300 Foot from their old Paths; the Eaſt-Parts turned to the Weſt, &amp; the Weſt turned to the Eaſt, Paſturage being left in the place of Tillage, and Tillage on the other ſide overſpreading the Paſturage. Thus about 26 Acres of Ground travelled 3 days together, till being raiſed to a Hill 12 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms high, there it reſted.</p>
                        <p>This County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and its Inhabitants known among the Romans by the Name of <hi>Silures</hi>) is now in the Dioceſe of <hi>Hereford.</hi>

                        <p>In former time this County was very Woody, being counted a Foreſt, and ſuch as afforded excellent Game for Hunting, from whence it took its Denomination.

The Whole divided into five <hi>Lathes</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sutton, Aylesford, Scray, St. Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Shepway Lathes,</hi>) and theſe into 67 <hi>Hundreds;</hi> wherein 408 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 30 <hi>Market Towns.</hi> Which is an Argument of its Populouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Air</hi> is neither ſo ſerene, nor ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here, as in other Counties, eſpecially near the Sea and Marſhes; which makes this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49236:75"/>ſo noted for its Kentiſh Agues. Now, that you may know in few words the Nature of this Country, both as to its Air and Soil, I ſhall bring in the Remark made upon it, which is, that there are 3 Ridges of Hills in Kent, one called Health without Wealth, the ſecond Health and Wealth, and the third Wealth without Health. Others, as to the Soil, give this different Character of it. <hi>The Weald</hi> for Wood, <hi>Eaſt Kent</hi> for Corn, <hi>Rumney</hi> for Meadow, <hi>Tenham</hi> for an Orchard, <hi>Shepey</hi> and <hi>Reculver</hi> for Wheat, <hi>Thanet</hi> for Barley, and <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> for Capons.</p>
                        <p>In general this may be ſaid of Kent, that it is a Country very good for Corn, and fit for Paſturage, according to the ſeveral Plots and Parts thereof; and wondrous full of fruitful and well-ordered Orchards, from whence the City of London is ſupplied with moſt ſorts of Fruit, but chiefly with Pippins and Cherries, which are counted the beſt in England. On the Cliffs between Deal and Dover, there grows a great ſtore of Samphire.</p>
                        <p>The ſame is well watered with <hi>Rivers.</hi> For, beſides the <hi>Thames</hi> that waſhes its North Parts, here is the <hi>Medway,</hi> which in a manner parts it in the middle, the <hi>Stower</hi> that runs by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, the <hi>Tun</hi> through Tunbridge, and the <hi>Rother</hi> upon which Appledore is ſeated, not to mention the <hi>leſſer Streams.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of all the Counties in England, this was the firſt Kingdom of the Heptarchy, and had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular King to it ſelf, which no other County ever had. Neither was it conquered by the Normans, the Kentiſh Men yielding upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and having their ancient Franchiſes and Cuſtoms confirmed to 'em by William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. One of which is the <hi>Cavelkind,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49236:75"/>they are not ſo bound by Copy-hold as in other Parts of England; Lands of this nature being equally divided here among the male Children, and for want of Males, among the Females. By the ſame Law they are at age at 15 years old, and they may ſell or make over the Land without the conſent of the Lord. Alſo, the Son (tho of a convicted Father for Felony or Murder) ſucceeds him in ſuch Kind of Lands.</p>
                        <p>The Kentiſh Men beſides have this to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in, that they were the firſt Chriſtians of this Iſland. And this is the only County at this time that has two Cities, or Epiſcopal Sees, namely Canterbury and Rocheſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the chief Place of this County, is 46 miles Eaſt of London, Viz. from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to <hi>Dartford,</hi> 12; to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> 11 more; from thence to <hi>Sittingborn,</hi> 10; and to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> 13 more.</p>
                        <p>A City of great Antiquity, if it was built (as ſome Authors aver) 900 years before Chriſt. 'Tis ſeated on the River <hi>Stower,</hi> (noted for breeding the beſt Trouts in the South Eaſt Parts of <hi>England,</hi>) and is counted in the Lath of S. Auguſtine. The Buildings of it but mean, and the Wall which encompaſſes it, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed condition. The greateſt Ornament of all is the Cathedral, wherein ly interred the Bodies of eight Kings. For this City had been the Seat of the Kings of Kent, till given by Ethelbert, the firſt Chriſtian King of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to Auguſtine the firſt Archbiſhop thereof, and his Succeſſors. Whereupon the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Seat to <hi>Reculver,</hi> a Town by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. In this Cathedral is alſo interred the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> once Archbiſhop hereof, that famous Saint ſo reverenced by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49236:76"/>In this City, and its Suburbs, are reckoned 14 Pariſh Churches; beſides a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place under the Cathedral, for the <hi>Walloon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But to the honour this City has had of being the Regal Seat of the firſt Kings of Kent, and of being to this day the See of the Primate of England, let us add the Coronation of King John and Queen Izabel his Wife, the Marriages of Henry II. and Edward I, and the Interments of Edward the black Prince, King Henry the Fourth, and Queen Joan his Wife, all which was performed in this Place.</p>

It is ſeated upon the Medway, over which it has a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stone-bridge, one of the faireſt in England. It conſiſts moſt of one principal Street, which extends it ſelf a long way; the Houſes being but ordinary, as they are inhabited for the moſt part but by Trades-men and Inn-keepers. Yet, beſides the Honour it has of being a Biſhops See, it is dignify'd with the Title of an Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Perſon of the Right Honourable <hi>Laurence Hyde,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Hyde,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Maidſtone</hi> is ſeated alſo on the Medway, but near the head of it. This is the Town where the County-Goal, Seſſions, and Aſſizes are kept; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveniently ſeated for that purpoſe, and a Place of good reſort.</p>

This Iſland called by the Saxons <hi>Thanet,</hi> from <hi>Thanatos,</hi> or <hi>Athanatos,</hi> by which Name it is found in <hi>Solinus,</hi> is about 9 Miles in length, and 8 in breadth at the broadeſt.</p>

Famous for being the Place which the Saxons landed at, when they firſt came into Britain; the firſt Livery and Seiſin which they had of the whole Kingdom, conferred by the improvident Bounty of Vortiger, to whoſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49236:80"/>Aid they were called in.

                           <p>At <hi>Stonar,</hi> a Port Town of this Iſland, is the Sepulchre (ſays <hi>Heylin</hi>) of <hi>Vortimer,</hi> King of the Britains.

At preſent it gives the Title of Counteſs to the Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, Counteſs of Shepey, Lady Dacres, &amp;c.

                        <p>The Country in general is well watered with <hi>Rivers;</hi> the chief whereof are the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> the <hi>Rible,</hi> and the <hi>Lon,</hi> all three running from Eaſt to Weſt into the Iriſh Sea. The <hi>Merſey</hi> Waters the South Parts, and ſerves for a Boundary betwixt this County and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; the <hi>Rible</hi> waters the middle; and the <hi>Lon,</hi> the North Parts.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe Rivers, and many others of leſs note, here are ſeveral great <hi>Meers</hi> (or <hi>Lakes,</hi>) as <hi>Merton,</hi> and <hi>Winder</hi> (or <hi>Wimander</hi>) Meer. This laſt divides part of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> from <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> reaching about 10 miles in length, and 3 or 4 in breadth. It has (as moſt Lakes in the North) a clear pebbly Bottom, whence the Saying, that this Lake is all paved with Stone. And it breeds great ſtore of Fiſh, particularly Trouts, Pikes, Pearches, Eels, and Skellies. But there's one ſort of Fiſh peculiar to it, and not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, except in <hi>Vlles Water,</hi> another Lake, bordering both upon Cumberland and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland. <hi>Charre</hi> is the Name of it, and 'tis a dainty Fiſh, whereof many Pies are yearly ſent abroad for Preſents.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, tho' this Country in general cannot be called a fruitfull Country, yet what is good of it yields abundance of good Graſs and Corn, the faireſt Oxen in England, and in general all ſorts of Proviſions. Fiſh and Fowl particularly here's great plenty of; and in the River Lon, near Cockerfand Abbey, is great ſtore of Salmon.</p>
                        <p>To make Linnen, here grows a great deal of Flax; for Fewel the Country yields, not only fat Earth, but good Coals; and for Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Quarries of good Stone.</p>

This Town, called by Antonine the Emperour <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunium,</hi> was a Station of the Romans. And it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49236:85"/>is to this day a Town much beyond Lancaſter, in beauty, and populouſneſs. Its chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the Colledge, and the Market-Place; but, above all, the Collegiate Church, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a ſmall Quire of excellent Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

Anno 1625. being then Lord Treaſurer, and Preſident of the Council, and afterwards Lord Privy Seal.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, 'tis a noted Place for its Linnen and Woollen Cloths; as alſo for its Cottons, which are held in great eſteem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Leverpool</hi> is the next Place of chief note in this County. Tis an excellent Sea-port, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly ſeated at the fall of the River Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey into the Sea, where it affords a ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Ships, and a convenient Paſſage into Ireland. To the immortal Praiſe of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Mores</hi> of <hi>Banck-hall,</hi> this Town has been very much improved and beautified, at their Charge and Induſtry. Here is a Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe erected upon Pillars and Arches of hewn Stone, and underneath an Exchange for the Merchants. Among its Antiquities, a Caſtle on the South-ſide, which commands the Pool, built by King John, during his ſtay here for a Wind to Ireland; and on the Weſt-ſide, upon the River, the Tower, being a ſtately and ſtrong Pile of Building.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49236:86"/>Town are held the Court of Chancery, and Offices of Juſtice for Lancaſter, as a County Palatine.</p>
                        <p>Not far from Preſton aforeſaid is a ſmall Town, from the River on which it is ſituate, called <hi>Rible-Cheſter,</hi> which has been eſteemed and called the richeſt Town in Chriſtendom. No doubt but it has been a Place of great account in the Time of the Romans, if we conſider the many Statues, pieces of Coin, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Pillars, Inſcriptions, and other Pieces of Antiquity, that have been often digged up here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wigan</hi> is another Town of note in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

                        <p>A City ſeated on the ſide of a Hill, the lower part whereof is watered by the River <hi>Witham;</hi> over which there are ſeveral Bridges, for the Conveniency of Paſſengers. A Place of great Antiquity, whoſe ancient ruinated
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49236:89"/>Places are ſtill an Argument of its former Greatneſs. In the Time of the Romans 'twas a Town of great ſtrength and fame; and, in the Time of the Normans a Place of great Trading. Whoſe flouriſhing Condition occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Epiſcopal See, then at Dorcheſter near Oxon, to be removed hither. But this City has gone through all the Calamities of Fire, Sword, and Earth-quake. Which has ſo much weakned and impaired it, that of 50 Churches it is ſaid to have had for divine Worſhip, there remains but 15, beſides the Cathedral.</p>
                        <p>In the Time of the Saxons, King Arthur drove away their Forces from this Place. The like did Edmund Ironſide to the Danes, who had made ſore havock thereof. On the 5th of Sept. 1140. here was a great Battel fought between King Stephen and Maud the Empreſs, in which the King was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and afterwards laid in irons in Briſtol. On the 19th of May 1217. here was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſore Battel fought betwixt King Henry III. and his diſloyal Barons, who ſtood for Lewis the Dauphin of France; in which the King got the day.</p>
                        <p>But, whatever Diſaſters and Calamities this City has gone through, ſtill 'tis a large, populous, and well frequented Place. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified not only with an Epiſcopal See, whoſe Dioceſe to this day is the greateſt of any in the Kingdom; but alſo for many Ages, with the Title of an Earldom. Which, having paſſed through ſeverall Families, with frequent Interruptions, came at laſt to be in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Edward Fiennes,</hi> Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> who being Lord Admiral in Queen Elizabeth's Time, was by her Majeſty created Earl

                        <p>The Cathedral, or Minſter, as now ſtanding, is one of the ſtatelieſt Piles in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and perhaps in Chriſtendom; high ſeated on a Hill, and from thence diſcerned over all the Country.

                           <hi>Chepſtow</hi> ſtands upon the ſide of a Hill, on the Banks of the Wye, near its fall into the Severn. A Town in former times famous, and of great reſort; ſuppoſed to be raiſed out of the Ruins of <hi>Venta Silurum,</hi> 4 miles diſtant, the ancient and chief City of the <hi>Silures,</hi> which flouriſhed in the Days of Antonine the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. This Town, ſays Cambden, was fortified about with a Wall of a large Circuit, and had a very ſpacious Caſtle, once fronted by a Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the better part of which being pulled down, the reſt was converted to a Pariſh Church. At this preſent time, the Town is large and well built, well inhabited, and frequented; having a fair and high Bridge over the Wye. And ſo it needs, for here the River riſes to a great height.</p>
                        <p>In the Year 1606. the Moor (or Marſh) near Chepſtow was very much indamaged by the Severn. For that Year, at the Change of the Moon in February, this River at a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49236:96"/>was driven back for 3 days together with a South Wind. Which made it ſwell ſo high, that it came ruſhing in a main upon this Tract, and carried all before it.</p>

                           <hi>Newport,</hi> a goodly Town, is ſeated on the Uſke, over which it has a fair Bridge; the Uſke diſcharging it ſelf not far off into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, where it has a good Haven, bearing the Name of the Town.</p>
                        <p>Some miles Eaſt from this Haven is the <hi>Gold-Cliff,</hi> ſo called from the golden Colour of the Stones that lie hereabouts; which makes ſome ſuſpect a Mine to be there. And oppoſite to that Cliff, about the midſt of the Severn, lieth a ſmall Iſle, called <hi>Denny-Iſland.</hi>

'Tis beautified with well built Stone-houſes, and formerly was fortified with a large and ſtrong Caſtle, now ruinated. According to Antonine, here ſtood the little City <hi>Burrium.</hi> But, not far from it Northward is <hi>Ragland Caſtle,</hi> a noble Seat belonging to the Duke of Beaufort.</p>

This is a Place of ſome ſtrength, being forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Walls, and a Caſtle of great note in former times. The Town is large, the Houſes well built, and injoy's a good Trade, for Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels eſpecially.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caer-Leon,</hi> by the Romans called <hi>Iſca Silurum,</hi> ſtands alſo upon the Uſke, a little above <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and has a large wooden Bridge over the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49236:97"/>River. This Town was once, a famous and flouriſhing City in the time of the Romans, where lay the ſecond Roman Legion called <hi>Augusta,</hi> to keep the <hi>Silures</hi> in aw. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of its ſtately Buildings, Palaces, Temples, Theaters, together with the Water-pipes, Vaults, Hot-Houſes, Altars, and Roman Coyns, often digged up here, do ſufficiently evidence its former Antiquity and Greatneſs. Here King Arthur kept his Court; and in this City was a famous School or Colledge, to learn Aſtronomy, and other Arts. As for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, the Town is pretty large, and the Houſes for the generality built of Stone. It has yet the Ruins of a Caſtle ſtanding.</p>

A Town of good antiquity, large, and well built, containing 3 Pariſh-Churches; and for its Defence, incompaſſed with a Wall, and a good Ditch. Well Inhabited by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Tradeſmen, who drive a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trade, and the more by reaſon of its commodious Haven. Yet it is much eclipſed in its Trade, to what it was formerly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſtoppage of a Sluce upon the Ouſe, which do's ſo obſtruct the Current of ſalt Water, that the River is ſcarce navigable to Cambridge.</p>
                        <p>Nigh unto this Town, on the other ſide of the Ouſe, is a little Marſh Country, called <hi>Marſh-Land,</hi> very ſubject to the Inundations of the Sea, and therefore very moiſt and aguiſh. But, in recompence, its Soil is exceeding fat, and feed abundance of Cattel. In this Marſh are ſeated ſeveral Towns, but ſo deſtitute of freſh Water for houſhold Uſe, that many of 'em are fain to get a ſupply thereof at 4 miles diſtance.</p>
                        <p>About 3 miles from <hi>Lyn,</hi> towards the Sea, ſtands a decayed Town called <hi>Caſtle-Riſing.</hi> Its Decay occaſioned by its Haven's being many years ſince choakt up with Sands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis become uſeleſs.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49236:99"/>ſame is well inhabited, and much reſorted unto by Seamen; affording a ready Paſſage to Holland, and being a frequent Shelter to the New-caſtle Fleets, when diſtreſſed by Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of ſpecial note beſides, for Herring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing, in the Seas adjacent, in the Month of September.

A Place of great Antiquity, built out of the Ruins of the ancient City <hi>Sitomagus,</hi> which was deſtroyed by the mercileſs Danes. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's See of the Eaſt Angles was from North-Elmham removed hither, and from hence to Norwich. It is not very well Inhabited, to what it has been.

                        <p>Among the aforeſaid Towns, <hi>Walſingham</hi> was formerly renowned, as for its Colledge of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, ſo for the continual Concourſe of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims to this Place.

                        <p>Near Burnham-Market, within 2 Miles from it to the Weſtward, is a ſmall Country-Town, called <hi>Brancaſter,</hi> the Ruins of an ancient Town known by the Name of <hi>Branodunum.</hi> Seated near the Sea-ſhore, and a Place of good account in the time of the Romans, who kept here a Garriſon.</p>
                        <p>Not far from Hickling, in the North-Eaſt Parts, is the ancient decay'd <hi>Abbey of St. Bennet's in the Holme,</hi> built by the Daniſh King Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. An Abbey ſo fortified afterwards by its Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it ſeemed rather a Caſtle than a Cloyſter; and yet was betrayed by a Monk to William the Conqueror. The Biſhop of Norwich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to this Day the Title of Lord Abbot of St. Bennets. And it is obſervable, that hereabouts both Cockles and Perwinkles are digged out of the Ground.</p>

                        <p>Laſtly, this County (which is the largeſt in England next to Yorkſhire, but much more populous) was Part of the Kingdom of the Eaſt-Angles, in the time of the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants, part of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> as the Romans called them.</p>
                        <p>It is obſerved of the People in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they are notably induſtrious for Plough and Manufactures, inſomuch that one ſhall hardly ſee a Beggar throughout all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And yet (which one would wonder at) they are notable Wranglers, and generally ſo well verſed in the Quirks of the Law, that they create more work for the Aſſizes than almoſt all the Circuit elſe. Accordingly Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk is the County, which commonly yields the beſt Breed of Lawyers, and has furniſhed the Courts of Juſtice with many an emiment Man in the Laws of England. But a great Antiquary has made another material Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That in this County are a hundred Families of ancient Gentry, that never were attainted of high Treaſon. Which if it be true, the Gentry here have had better fortune than the Dukes, Dutcheſſes, and Earls of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</p>
                        <p>His Grace, <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> the preſent Duke of Norfolk, derives his Title from his noble Anceſtor <hi>John-Lord Howard,</hi> created Duke of Norfolk by King Edward IV.

                           <hi>NORTHAMPTONSHIRE,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land County, is bounded <hi>on the Eaſt</hi> with the Counties of Cambridge, Huntington, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and Buckingham; <hi>on the Weſt,</hi> with Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Leiceſterſhire, and Warwickſhire; <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> with the Counties of Lincoln, Rutland, and Leiceſter; <hi>Southward,</hi> with Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Oxfordſhire.</p>
                        <p>This County, being long, but narrow, runs in <hi>Length,</hi> from North to South, ahout 50 miles; and in <hi>Breadth,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, but half. The Whole divided into 20 <hi>Hundreds,</hi> wherein 326 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 13 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here the <hi>Air</hi> is temperate and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; the <hi>Soil</hi> as rich, either for Corn or Graſs, as in any Place in England. And the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants find ſuch a Profit here by Grazing and Tillage, that they improve the Ground every where. Inſomuch that it is ſaid, there is leſs waſte Ground in this County than in any other.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Rivers,</hi> and other freſh Streams, 'tis as well watered as moſt Counties are. Its principal Rivers are the <hi>Nen</hi> and the <hi>Weland,</hi> both having their Riſe here; beſides the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> which riſes in the South Parts, near Bucking, hamſhire.</p>
                        <p>A further Proof of the excellency of this County might be fetched from its Populouſneſs. For it is ſo garniſhed with Towns, that in many Places 20 or 30 Steeples preſent themſelves at one view. And conſidering its Extent, 'tis ſaid to be honoured with the Seats of as many (if not more) of the Nobility and Gentry, as any County in the Kingdom.</p>

And, though it has ſuffered much by the ſore hand of the Dane, and other Calamities (and of late particularly by the dreadfull Fire which buried it all in Aſhes in September 1675) yet it has raiſed it ſelf again more glorious than before. So that for Circuit and Beauty it may at this time be ranked with many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Fortified heretofore with good Walls, and a ſtrong Caſtle; and ſeated in ſo good an Air, that once the Students of Cambridge had a mind to remove their Univerſity hither. Here the Inhabitants drive a conſiderable Trade, eſpecially of Leather; and its Market, which is on Saturdays, is well ſerved with Proviſions. This Town is the Place where the County-Goal, and the Aſſizes are kept. Of ſpecial note, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <hi>George Compton,</hi> the preſent Earl of Northampton.

                        <p>Its <hi>Form</hi> is triangular, contains in <hi>Length</hi> from North to South about 40 long Miles, and in <hi>Breadth</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt (at the broadeſt) 30. The Whole divided into ſix <hi>Wards,</hi> wherein 460 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and but 6 <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Towns.</hi>

                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:49236:104"/>
                        <p>The <hi>Air</hi> of this County is ſharp and piercing in Winter, and ſometimes troubled with deep Snows and pinching Froſts, ſutable to its Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. But yet 'tis nothing near ſo ſharp as the People. And by my late Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, here wet Weather is not ſo ſenſible and ſearching, as it is in Middleſex. 'Tis poſſible the warm Breaths that continually come out of its numberleſs Colepits helps, with the Vapours of the Sea, to take off the rawneſs of a cold dampiſh Air.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Soil,</hi> as this County is nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Scotland, ſo it is one of the worſt Counties in England; being for the moſt part rough and hilly, and hard to be manured. Yet in ſome Parts, chiefly towards the Sea, it is fertile enough. But the greateſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Country lies in the Bowels of the Earth, full of Coal-mines. Which ſupply with Coals, not only this Country (where that Fewel is always bought at very eaſy rates) but a good Part of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; and London particularly, for whoſe Uſe many hundred Sail of Ships have yearly from hence their Loading.</p>
                        <p>The Coal-Pits, made uſe of to get up this Treaſure, are all ſquare, commonly 7 or 8 foot in diameter, and timbered from top to bottom; ſome 30, ſome 40, more or leſs, but few above 50 fadoms deep. A great Depth for Workmen, to go and rake a Livelyhood. And yet here is a Legion of ſuch Men, bred and born to it, that ſpend moſt of their Life in this Land of Darkneſs; in continual Danger (beſides that of the Rope) of being cruſhed below by a <hi>Thruſt,</hi> ſometimes in Danger of Water, and in ſome places of Fire.</p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49236:104"/>
                        <p>The Way to go down theſe Pits, and to come up, is by the help of a Rope; one end whereof being made into a Loop, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gets a Leg and Knee into it, as far as the very Hip. Thus hugging the Rope with one Arm, his Life wrapt up with it, down he goes, while the Rope turns about an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine made for that purpoſe. If the Rope fails, as ſometimes it does through Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there's an end of the Man and of the Conveyance.</p>
                        <p>By a <hi>Thruſt</hi> is meant the fall of ſome Earth, or great Stones, whereby 'tis the ill fate of ſome to be cruſhed; as it is of others to be drowned by a ſudden Irruption of Waters, from an old Waſte, or otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>But ſome Pits at Sunderland, in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Durham, are ſubject beſides to <hi>Fire-Damps.</hi> So they call an Inflammation of the Air in thoſe ſubterraneous Parts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than ordinary affected with ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter, are ſometimes apt to catch fire, and then all go's to wrack. It breaks out like a Thunder-bolt, carries all away with it higher than the Pits Mouth, and that with a diſmal noiſe, as it were with a crack of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In this Caſe one might compare the inflamed Sulphur to Gun-powder, the Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to a great Gun, and what it brings up with it to Bullets, it comes up with ſuch a force. But, when this happens, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men foreſee it, by their Candles burning blue and blazing more than ordinary. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they lay themſelves flat upon the Ground, and let the Meteor work it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it.</p>

Over the River it has a fair Stone-Bridge leading to Gateſhead in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of Durham, with an Iron-Gate upon it, which parts the two Counties. It ſtands high and low, part upon a ſteep Hill, and part in the bottom on't near the River. The Streets upon the Aſcent are ſo very ſteep, that they ſtand like ſo many Ladders. And yet both Men and Horſes are ſo uſed to 'em, that they make little of it, either with or without a Load. The Houſes are moſt of Stone, ſome Timber, and a few Brick-houſes. In ſhort, it is a Place of that extent as to contain four large Pariſhes, with as many Churches.

                           <hi>Barwick</hi> is ſeated at the mouth of the River Twede, over which it has a fair Bridge, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49236:106"/>by no leſs than 14 or 15 Arches. But as it ſtands on the North ſide of the River, by the Bounds of Northumberland, it ought rather to be counted in Scotland than En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. And, becauſe it has been in the hands of the Engliſh from the Reign of Edward IV, therefore in all Acts of Parliament, and Royal Proclamations, wherein this Town is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, <hi>Barwick upon Twede</hi> is always named by it ſelf, as a diſtinct Part of this Realm, and of Northumberland by conſequence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as it is ſo near a Neighbour to this County, I am unwilling to deviate from the Method of all Geographers, whoſe way is to bring it under this Head, as if it were a part of Northumberland.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, <hi>Barwick,</hi> by its Situation, is a Place of good Strength, being almoſt ſurrounded with Water, what with the Sea, and what with the River. But it is fortified beſides with good Walls and a Caſtle, beſides other Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. The Occaſion of it was its being a Frontire-Town, ſometimes poſſeſſed by the Scots, and ſometimes by the Engliſh, before theſe two Nations came to be united under one Head. So that, upon the leaſt Rupture, this Town was ſure to undergo the firſt brunts of the War. It is large and populous, and the Houſes well built; injoying a good Trade, eſpecially for Corn and Salmon. Here one may have a good Salmon for 12 pence.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>Barwick</hi> is, like Newcaſtel, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it ſelf. Dignified alſo with the Title of a Dukedom, and that by the late King James, in the perſon of <hi>James Fitz-James,</hi> the preſent Duke of Barwick, his natural Son, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Once ſtrengthened with a great Caſtle, which is now ſomething ruinous. However a noted Place, for the Battel fought here between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and the Scots, in the Reign of Henry II; where William, King of Scots, was taken Priſoner.</p>

This Iſland, being in ſhape not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Wedge, runs out with a Neck of Land towards Northumberland.

In this Fight Cuthbert had the fortune to overthrow the Mercian King, and to win his Banner, wherein was depicted a golden Dragon. The Memory whereof has continued for ſeveral Ages in the Cuſtom uſed here of making a Dragon yearly, and carrying it about the Town in great Jollity on Midſummer Eve, with the addition of a Giant to it. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Burford</hi> is a famons Place for Saddles; and ſomething advantaged beſides by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Downs, much reſorted unto by the Gentry for Horſe races.

The Barge-Men beſides of Henley, which make up a good Part of its Inhabitants, gain a good Livelyhood by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Malt, Wood, and other Goods to London.

And here are ſtill to be ſeen the Remains of a ſtately Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, founded by the foreſaid Earl of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery. Beſides the natural Strength of this Place, it is fenced about with a ſtrong Wall, with a Bulwark ranging from the Caſtle unto (and part along) the Severn. On the Eaſt and Weſt there are three Entrances into the Town by two fair Stone-bridges, with Gates, Towers, and Bars; and on the North, by a Gate, over which ſtands the Caſtle, once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong.

                        <p>'Tis bounded <hi>on the Eaſt</hi> by Wiltſhire and part of Devonſhire; <hi>on the West,</hi> by Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; <hi>Northward,</hi> by the Severn Sea, and part of Gloceſterſhire; <hi>Southward,</hi> by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Devon and Dorſet.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Length,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, is about 55 miles; its <hi>Breadth,</hi> from North to South, 40. The Whole divided into 42 <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,</hi> wherein 385 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 30 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Air</hi> of this County, in the Summer Seaſon, is very agreeable; but, in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, 'tis apt to be too moiſt and foggy.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly the <hi>Soil</hi> in Winter is wet, miry, and mooriſh, eſpecially in the midſt of the Country, which makes the Roads very uneaſy to Travellers. But in Summer there is no pleaſanter Country, being garniſhed (as it is) with rich Paſtures and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meadows. Which has given occaſion to an uſual Proverb here, that <hi>what is worſe for the Rider is beſt for the Abider.</hi>

                        <p>In this County are three Cities, <hi>Briſtol, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Wells. Briſtol</hi> indeed ſtands alſo in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire; and, as I have already deſcribed it there, I ſhall paſs it over here.</p>

                        <p>It is ſo called from its Medicinal hot Baths, much reſorted unto from all Parts, as being found by long experience to be of great virtue in the curing of Aches and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                        <p>Its Situation is on the River <hi>Avon,</hi> over which it has a Stone-Bridge; and there it lies in a low and ſmall Plain, ſurrounded with Hills very high and ſteep, out of which iſſue forth ſeveral Springs of Water, which pay Tribute to it. This is a Place of great Antiquity, as does appear by many Roman Inſcriptions and Images commonly found in the Walls which incompaſs it. And where the Abbey now ſtands, 'tis ſaid there was of old a Temple conſecrated to Minerva, the Goddeſs of Fountains and Baths.

                        <p>The <hi>Croſs Bath,</hi> ſo called from a Croſs that formerly ſtood in the midſt of it, is Triangular, about 25 foot long, and as broad at one end. This is of a more gentle heat than the reſt, becauſe it has fewer Springs. About 100 foot from it is the <hi>Hot-Bath,</hi> ſo called, becauſe formerly it was much hotter than the reſt, when it was not ſo large as now it is.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>King's Bath</hi> is about 60 foot ſquare, and has about the middle of it many hot Springs riſing, whence it has the greater heat. The <hi>Queen's Bath</hi> has no Spring in it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives the Water from the King's Bath, from which it is only divided by a Wall; and ſo it is more temperate than the King's. In theſe two Baths is a Pump, to pump Water upon the Diſeaſed, where ſtrong Embrocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are required.</p>
                        <p>In every one of the <hi>Baths</hi> are Seats of Stone, for the conveniency of thoſe that uſe 'em. But from 8 a Clock in the morning till about 3 in the afternoon, theſe Baths are ſhut up, and none permitted entrance; being then ſo very hot, that they work and caſt up a filth from the bottom.</p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Bath</hi> do not only find a great advantage by theſe Medicinal Springs, but alſo by their Cloth Manufacture, wherein they drive a conſiderable Trade.

The firſt is a large, well-inhabited, and frequented Town, adorned with the Title of an Earldom, in the perſon of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>John Egerton,</hi> the preſent Earl of Bridgewater. Derived to him from his Father <hi>John Egerton,</hi> created Earl of Brigewater by King James I. Anno 1617. Which Title was formerly injoyed by <hi>Henvy</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeney,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced from a Knight to this Dignity by King Henry VIII; he being Son of that <hi>Giles Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beney,</hi> who came in with King Henry VII. from Bretagne in France. But he dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, this Title died with him; till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, as aforeſaid.</p>

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that this was a Shelter to the Britains in the latter Times of the Britiſh Churches, when they were miſerably haraſſed and perſecuted by the Pagan Saxons And it might be (as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſays) of far greater requeſt among the Britains, becauſe it was the Place where King <hi>Arthur</hi> was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Whoſe Body was found there very deep in the Earth in the Reign of Henry II, with a Latine Inſcription on a leaden Croſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49236:119"/>that King Arthur lay there buried in the Iſland of <hi>Avalon.</hi> And his Body was laid ſo deep for fear of the Saxons, this being a Place of Retreat in the Britiſh Times, but not without the apprehenſion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Invaſion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Axebridge</hi> is ſo called from the River Axe, on which it is ſituate, <hi>Pensford</hi> and <hi>Caneſham</hi> ly North and by Eaſt from Axebridge; both ſeated on the Chire, and the laſt at its very fall into the Avon, near Briſtol. <hi>Philip-Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Froumſelwood</hi> ſtand near the Froume, on the Confines of Wiltſhire. <hi>Shepton-Malles</hi> and <hi>Somerton</hi> ly South and by Weſt from 'em; both pretty large, but poor Towns. Whereas <hi>Somerton</hi> (as I ſaid before) was once a Place of ſuch note, that the Shire took its Name from it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> ſo called from the River <hi>Ill,</hi> or <hi>Yeovel,</hi> upon which it is ſeated, is a Town of great Antiquity, and was once a Place of good Strength. Then it had 16 Pariſh Churches, now reduced to two. However this is the Place where the County-Goal is kept. <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Yeovel,</hi> ſtands upon the ſame River, and grows by the decay of of its Neighbour Ilcheſter.</p>

                        <p>But, to conclude, this County in general is noted for two Things, beſides the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The firſt, for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace, <hi>Charles Seymour,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford, &amp;c.</hi> Deſcended from <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and Lord Protector of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sixth, who was beheaded Anno 1552. But, upon the Reſtauration of King Charles the Second, the Title was reſtored to the Line in the perſon of <hi>William Seymour,</hi> the great Grandchild of the foreſaid Duke; from whom it is now devolved to the preſent Duke, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Francis</hi> who was killed in Italy.</p>
                        <p>'Tis remarkable beſides, that this County was few Years ſince the Scene which brought the late Duke of Monmouth, with many of his Followers, to their tragical End; and gave an Opportunity to the Popiſh Party, by the uncontroulable Authority of the late King James, to hurry on their Deſign of Intailing Popery and Slavery upon theſe Nations. Which was wonderfully defeated, under God, by the Magnanimity of our preſent King.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> and its Inhabitants Part of the <hi>Belgae</hi> in the Time of the Romans) is now in the Dioceſe of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The <hi>Air</hi> is counted here pretty good and healthfull, but it is ſomewhat ſharp in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Soil,</hi> 'tis true the greateſt Part of the Country is taken up with Moors, and Woods; inſomuch that one may go the whole length of the County, and ſee little but Heaths and Moors. But they are ſuch as yield both profit and pleaſure. Profit, by breeding Multitudes of Sheep, Deer, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and many of 'em by the Husbandmans Induſtry, yielding very good Corn. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for they afford the greateſt plenty of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49236:120"/>Heath-Game of any County in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, either by Hawking or Hunting. And ſo great was formerly the Number of Parks and Warrens in this Shire, that there was ſcarce any Gentlemans Seat in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but what had both Park and Warrens. The chief Foreſts are thoſe of Cank and Kinvare; and among Chaſes, thoſe of Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Peaſey, and Alderwas Hay.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, the North Part of this Country is full of Hills, and Woods, the South ſtored with Coals and Mines of Iron, and the middle Part (being watered with the River Trent) adorned with fair Corn-fields and Meadows. And yet in the North-Parts the Paſtures near the River Dove yield the ſweeteſt and fatteſt Mutton in England.</p>
                        <p>For Manuring the Ground, here's plenty both of Lime and Marl. For Building, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Timber and Stone, which laſt for its fineneſs and durableneſs is held in good eſteem. A ſort of Plaiſter is made of the Lime, which ſoon after it is laid, grows as white as Snow, and as hard as a Stone. Here is alſo a good deal of Alabaſter; and, in ſome Places, ſalt Springs, yielding plenty of white Salt, not much inferiour to the beſt Salt in Cheſhire.</p>
                        <p>The Hills of moſt note are <hi>Mowcop-hill,</hi> in the Confines of Cheſhire, where Mill-ſtones are got; <hi>Dudley-hill,</hi> which affords a fine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; the <hi>Shaw,</hi> which overlooks the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Darby and Leiceſter; and the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

                        <p>With Rivers, Springs, and Brooks, no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in England is better watered than this.

And over all theſe Rivers are reckoned at leaſt 24 Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges.</p>
                        <p>But as the Gentry here are not ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their private Buildings as they be in other Places, to amongſt the numerous Towns that are here few can boaſt of any Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                        <p>A Town pleaſantly ſeated on the Banks of the-River <hi>Sowe,</hi> which waſhes its South and Weſt Parts, with a Bridge over it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly fenced with a Wall, except where it was ſecured by a large Pool or Water on the North and Eaſt. Here are two Pariſh-Churches, a free School, and a fine Market-Place. The Streets are large, and graced with many good Buildings. And its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is well ſerved with moſt ſorts of Proviſions.</p>
                        <p>This Town did formerly belong to the noble Family of the <hi>Staffords,</hi> firſt with the Title of Earl hereof and afterwards of Lord or Baron. <hi>Henry Stafford</hi> was the laſt of that Line, who dying Anno 1639, the Family of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49236:121"/>the Staffords died alſo with him. But, the next year after, <hi>William Howard,</hi> Knight of the Bath, and ſecond Son of Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, having to Wife a Daughter of the laſt Lord Stafford, was by King Charles I. created Viſcount and Lord Stafford. Who, being found Guilty of High Treaſon by his Peers, Dec. 7th 1680, was beheaded upon Tower-Hill Dec. 29. But the Title was in the late Reign revived in his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> the preſent Earl of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Lichfield,</hi> a City and County of it ſelf, ſeated in a low and Mooriſh Ground, on a ſhallow Pool, by which it is divided into two Parts, both joyned together by a Bridge and a Cauſey, and making up a City of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bigneſs. In the South Part, which is the greater of the two, ſtands a Grammar-School for the Education of Children, and an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal dedicated to S. John, for the Relief of the Poor. In the other Parts there's nothing conſiderable but a fair Cathedral, and that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it ſelf to renoun the Place. Firſt built by Oſwin, King of Northumberland, about the Year 656, who gave the Biſhops hereof many Poſſeſſions. Afterwards being taken down by Roger de Clinton, the 37th Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of this Dioceſe, that which now ſtands was built by him, and dedicated to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary and S. Chad. Beſides the Cathedral, this City has 3 Pariſh Churches. And its Weekly Markets, kept on Tueſdays and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, are well ſerved with Proviſions.</p>

But, that Storm being over, it began in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Time to recover it ſelf. So that at this preſent, whether we conſider its Extent, Populouſneſs, or Trade, it yields to very few Cities in England. It reaches a mile in length, and above a mile in breath, with no leſs than 12 Pariſh Churches, which ſhews its Populouſneſs.</p>

                        <p>Among which <hi>Bury,</hi> or <hi>S. Edmunds Bury,</hi> is the moſt remarkable; being ſo called from King <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr, here interred. Who, for not renouncing the Chriſtian Faith, was ſhot to death at Hoxon by the Danes, and his Body ſtuck by degrees with Arrows. In this Town was erected the firſt Chriſtian Church by Sigebert, King of the Eaſt-Angles, in which King Edmund was buried. And, in Memory of him, here was erected a moſt ſtately Abbey, of which and the Town it ſelf take this Deſcription from an ancient Author. The Sun, ſays he, has not ſeen a Town more finely or delicately ſeated, upon the Eaſt Aſcent of a Hill, with a River running on the Eaſt ſide. Nor a more ſtately Abbey, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable either for Magnificence or Revenues, in whoſe proſpect appeareth rather a City than a Monaſtery. So many Gates it has for entrance, and many of them Braſs; ſo many Towers; and, above all, a moſt glorious Chuch. Upon which attend three others, ſtanding all in the ſame Church-yard, all of them very fine, and of curious Artifice. The Town, at preſent, do's conſiſt of two Pariſh-Churches; the Houſes pretty well built; the Market-hill, Fair-ſtead, and Corn-Croſs, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and handſom. And for what remains of the Abbey it ſelf (in whoſe Yard ſtands an old Shire-Houſe) 'tis far more majeſtick, than any other Ruins of its kind. The Market is of ſpecial note, for the extraordinary Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Corn brought to it, for which 'tis uſually the Standard of the Country. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not far from this Town was that great Battel fought againſt King Henry the Second, where this King had the good fortune to overthrow Robert Earl of Leiceſter, with his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49236:126"/>Rabble of Flemings, who joyned with the rebellious Son of King Henry, the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Wife being taken Priſoners.</p>

                           <hi>Stow-Market</hi> and <hi>Needham</hi> are both ſeated upon the Orwell. The firſt, as it were, in the Center of the County, having a fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect down the River Eaſtward. 'Tis a large and beautifull Town, graced with a ſpacious Church, and its Steeple adorned with a huge and lofty Pinnacle, not eaſy to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled.

                           <hi>Needham,</hi> an ominous Name, drives ſtill a Trade (but leſs than formerly) in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk blue and broad Cloths for Ruſſia, Turky, and orher Countries. Which creates ſpinning Work for the poorer ſort of Women, whilſt others get a Livelyhood by making of Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>

                           <hi>Debenham,</hi> and <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> are on the River. Deben. The laſt a large Town, ſeated on the Eaſt-ſide of a ſandy Hill, watered with ſeveral Streams, and having a pleaſant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect down the River Deben, which about 12 miles lower diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea. Here is a fair Church, with ſeveral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it. In the midſt of its Market-Place is alſo a fair Pile of brick, in a Chamber whereof are held the Quarter-Seſſions for the Liberty of S. Ethelred and Audry. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket well traded unto, eſpecially for Hemp. In this Town are four or five good Docks for building of Ships, moſt of 'em well imploy'd, and noted among Seamen for good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. The Inhabitants, for their part, drive a conſiderable Trade by Sea, for which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49236:126"/>they are furniſhed with ſeveral Ships of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And the principal Commodities they deal in are Butter, Cheeſe, Pouldavis, Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, Planks, &amp;c. beſides their refining of Salt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Orford,</hi> a few miles Eaſt and by South from Woodbridge, is ſeated between the River Ore on the Eaſt and a ſmaller Stream on the Weſt, within two miles from the Sea. Here is a Church well mounted, but unſightly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and hard by it the Ruins of a high cloſe-built Caſtle. Which, together with the Church-Steeple, are good Directions to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as the Light-houſe at the Neſs is by night.</p>
                        <p>In the Reign of Henry the Second (ſay's Sir Richard Baker) there was taken near <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> a Fiſh in the Shape of a Man, which was kept in the Caſtle above 6 months. This Fiſh eat all manner of Meat, but delighted chiefly in Fiſh. An Author that comments upon it ſays very ſeriouſly, that <hi>he ſpoke not one Word,</hi> and Reaſon good, for it was a Fiſh; and that <hi>the People brought him ſometimes to Church, but he never ſhewed any Sign of Adoration,</hi> which is no wonder of a Fiſh. At length, for want of looking to, this Man-Fiſh ſtole into the Sea, and was never more ſeen, <hi>becauſe</hi> (I gueſs) <hi>the Water was his Element.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here is ſomething more admirable. On the narrow ſtony Beach, that ſhoots Southerly betwixt the Town and the Sea, 'tis ſaid that in the Year 1555, when there was a great Dearth, there ſprang up among the <hi>Meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhingle</hi> ſuch Quantities of Peaſe, that the People gathered of 'em above 100 Quarters; which both abated the price of Corn, and preſerved many from famiſhing. And at the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49236:127"/>South Point of it, there ſtill comes up yearly certain courſe gray Peaſe, and good Coleworts out of the Stone-heaps.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alborough,</hi> another Coaſt-Town, ly's 2 miles North-Eaſt of <hi>Orford.</hi> Pleaſantly ſeated in a Dale, between the Sea on the Eaſt, a high Hill on the Weſt where ſtands a large and old-built Church, and a ſmall River that runs to the Southward. This is a long, large, and plain-built Town, with mean Houſes. Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted for its Fiſhery, for which they have a commodious Key at <hi>Slaughden,</hi> a quarter of a mile Southwards; and, along the Beach towards <hi>Orford,</hi> Conveniencies above other Towns, for the drying of their North-Sea-Fiſh. A little North of the Town is a Village, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thorp,</hi> whence ſeveral Parts of the County are ſerved with Lobſters and Crabs.</p>

                           <hi>Dunwich,</hi> on the Sea-ſhore, was the firſt Biſhops See of the Eaſt-Angles, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Suffolk. Then a Town capable of that Dignity; now ruinous, decay'd, and for the greateſt part worn into the Sea. However it do's ſtill contain two Pariſh Churches. Fiſhing of Sprats in Winter, and of Herrings, Mackerels, Soles, and the like, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons, is the chief Imployment of its Inhabitants, as it is with thoſe of Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</p>

                           <hi>Swold,</hi> or <hi>Sowold,</hi> a few miles more North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſtands alſo by the Sea-ſide. Seated on a pleaſant Cliff, the Sea on the Eaſt, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on the South, the River Blithe with a Draw-bridge on the Weſt, and a ſmall Neck of Land on the North. So that it is almoſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49236:127"/>incompaſſed with Water, eſpecially at every floud. And, beſides the natural Situation of the Place, which renders it a Town of good ſtrength, here are planted on the Cliff ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pieces of Ordnance. Its Bay called <hi>Swolds Bay,</hi> ſo famous for Ships to ride in, is chiefly made by the Shooting forth of <hi>Eaſton Neſs,</hi> a little North of it, which is the moſt Eaſtern Part of all England.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Leſtoft</hi> is the moſt Northern Sea-Town of this County, and a good thriving Place. Its chief Trade conſiſts in fiſhing for Cod in the North Sea, and at home for Herrings, for which it lies moſt conveniently over againſt the chief Herring-Beds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beckles</hi> and <hi>Bungay</hi> are both ſeated on the banks of the Waveney. The firſt has two Pariſh-Churches; and a Grammar-School, with ten Scholarſhips for Emanuel Colledge in Cambridge. Here the Womens Imploy is to knit Worſted Stockings, whilſt at Diſs in Norfolk on the other ſide of the River they imploy themſelves in knitting of Silk ones.</p>

                           <hi>Haleſworth, Framlingham,</hi> and <hi>Eye,</hi> make a kind of Triangle. The firſt is a thriving Town for Retail Trade, dealing much in Linnen, Yarn and Sale Cloth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Framlingham,</hi> a good large Town, is ſeated upon a Clay-hill, near the head of the River Ore. Defended by a ſpacious tall Caſtle of Saxon Work, well walled, and double ditched on one part, with a large Meer on the other part. This Caſtle had once no leſs than 13 high Towers; and was counted ſo ſtrong, that Robert, the rebellious Earl of Leiceſter againſt King Henry the Second, took up his Quarters here. Its Inworks are now
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49236:128"/>much defaced, there being only a large Dwelling-houſe, a Grammar-School-Houſe,  but the Outworks are more like a Caſtle, than the Ruins of one.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eye,</hi> a pretty large Market-Town, and an ancient Corporation, is ſituate in a watery Place. It ſhew's a fair Church, with the Ruins of a Caſtle, and of an ancient Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine Abbey called S. Peter's. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Imploy in this Town is making of Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. This Corporation is a Peculiar of the Crown, an Honour of ancient Time, and has been given in Joynture with the Queens of England.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Buddeſdale,</hi> ſome miles Weſt of Eye, is but a little Borough-Town, ſeated (according to its Name) in a Dale. Here is a Grammar-School indowed, with certain Scholarſhips aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Bennet (or Corpus Chriſti Colledge) in Cambridge.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hadleigh</hi> and <hi>Lavenham</hi> are both ſeated on the River Breton, and <hi>Bilſton</hi> on a Rivulet that falls into it. The firſt a Town of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count formerly for its Clothing, has a fine Church, which is a great Ornament to it, and is a Peculiar of Canterbury. Of ſome note for the Martyrdom of Dr. Taylor, their ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time famous Miniſter, who ſuffered here for his Religion.</p>
                        <p>But, whereas <hi>Hadleigh</hi> is ſeated in a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>Lavenham</hi> on the contrary ſtands on an Eminence. This alſo has a comely and ſpacious Church and Steeple, injoy's a pretty good Trade, and is ſomething the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented for its famous Lecture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bilſton,</hi> or <hi>Bildeſton,</hi> is noted for its Blues and Blankets. And the Women here either ſpin corded Wool for the Clothier, or white Work for the Packer.</p>

                           <hi>Neyland, Sudbury, Clare,</hi> and <hi>Haverill,</hi> are all four ſeated on the River Stower. The firſt, in a rich Bottom, is a good Country Town, noted for its Clothing, but chiefly for its Bays and Sayes, wherein the Inhabitants drive a Trade with London.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sudbury</hi> is a good large Town, having a fair Bridge over the River Stower, which leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eſſex. It contains 3 Pariſh Churches, and drives a good Trade of Cloathing; being chiefly noted for Says, as Colcheſter in Eſſex for Bays. Of ſome Note beſides, for giving the Title of Baron to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Grafton.</hi>

                           <hi>Clare</hi> is a Town of more antiquity than beauty, having nothing to boaſt of but the Ruins of a Caſtle and Collegiate Church, but that it gave both Name and Title to that noble Family ſurnamed <hi>De Clare,</hi> who in their Times were Earls of <hi>Hartford, Clare,</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> The laſt of that Name was <hi>Gilbert de Clare,</hi> who died Anno 1295. He had a Siſter and Coheir, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by Name, the Wife of <hi>William de Burg,</hi> Earl of Ulſter in Ireland, by whom ſhe got a Daughter, their ſole Heir. To this great Heireſs <hi>Lionel,</hi> the third Son of King Edward III, was married, and upon his Marriage made Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Title being only changed, not the Place denominating.

                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides this firſt Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> I can find but two more. Viz. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſecond Son to King Henry IV, Lord Admiral, who was ſlain in France; and <hi>George,</hi> Brother to King Ed. ward IV, Lord Conſtable.</p>

                           <hi>Haveril,</hi> on the edge of Suffolk, Eſſex, and Cambridgeſhire, is a ſmall and plain Market-Town not far from the Head of the Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, adjoyning to the Saffron Grounds. The principal Trade here is Fuſtians.</p>

Here is a fair Church, with a very tall Steeple. And its Market does chiefly abound with Fiſh and wild Fowl from the Fens. Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is here the principal Imployment of the poorer ſort of Women.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iksworth</hi> is but a ſmall Market-Town, which (according to Cambden) retains in its Name the Memory of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> who partly dwelt in this County. In this Town are yet ſome Remains of an ancient Priory, founded by <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Blunt,</hi> Lord of the Town; as alſo of a Guild-Hall, where (not many years ſince) has been digged up a Pot of Roman Coyn, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſcriptions of divers Roman Emperours.</p>
                        <p>But, beſides the foreſaid Market-Tows, there are other Towns in Suffolk, which upon ſome account or other do deſerve a place here.</p>

From this Town to Ely, Henry Biſhop of Ely made a Cauſey or high Way.</p>

                           <hi>Brandon,</hi> ſeated upon the little Ouſe, over which it has a Bridge, was once a Market-Town, but has loſt that Conveniency. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis of ſome note for giving the Title of Baron to the Earl of <hi>Maclesfield.</hi> And, not far from it, is a noted Ferry, called from hence the <hi>Brandon Ferry,</hi> where Things come up from the Iſle of <hi>Ely.</hi>

This indeed is but a ſmall Place, but (as an Author deſcribes it) finely ſeated on a Flat, in a fair Champain Country, for pleaſure and delight. Which induced the late Earl of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington to raiſe a noble Structure there, called <hi>Euſton-Hall,</hi> of extraordinary Beauty. Adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which is a large Nurſery, containing 1560. Fruit-trees of ſeveral ſorts; beſides artificial Fountains, and a Canal which makes a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant noiſe as it falls into the River. There is alſo to be ſeen a Grove of near ten thouſand Trees, a large Warren, and many other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities. The Particulars whereof I ſhall wave, to acquaint the Reader, that upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the ſecond Son of the Dutcheſs of Cleveland to the only Daughter of the Earl of Arlington, it pleaſed King Charles II. that

                        <p>It contains in <hi>Length,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 35 miles; in <hi>Breadth,</hi> from North to South, 25. The Whole divided into thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Hundreds,</hi> wherein 140 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and yet but 8 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Skirts of this County are very rich and fruitfull, eſpecially towards the Thames, where it yields plenty both of Corn and Graſs; but the middle Parts are ſomewhat hard and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. From whence the People uſe to ſay, that their County was like a courſe piece of Cloth, with a fine Liſt.</p>
                        <p>But what the middle Parts want in Riches they ſupply with Pleaſures, as being famous for good <hi>Air,</hi> and well ſtored with Parks; the Downs affording excellent Opportunity as well for Horſe-races as Hunting.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Rivers,</hi> beſides the <hi>Thames</hi> aforeſaid, here is none of any Note but the <hi>Wey</hi> which runs through Guildford, the <hi>Mole</hi> through Darking, and the <hi>Wandle</hi> whoſe Spring-head is at Croydon. All which empty themſelves into the Thames, the firſt two near Hampton-Court, and the laſt near Richmond.</p>

                           <hi>Guilford,</hi> the County-Town, bears from London South-Weſt by Weſt, and (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Computation) is diſtant from it 25 miles, thus. From London to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> 10 miles; from Kingſton to <hi>Cobham,</hi> 7; and to <hi>Guilford,</hi> 8 more.</p>
                        <p>A Town no leſs pleaſantly than commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeated on the River Wey, which affords a good Advantage to the Inhabitants in the Conveyance of their Goods in Barges up to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49236:131"/>London, much facilitated by the ſeveral Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks or Sluces on the ſaid River. In old time it was the Royal Manſion of the Engliſh Saxon Kings, and then a Place of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than now it is. Near the River ſtand the broken Walls of an old large Caſtle; and in the midſt of the Town is a Church, the Weſt-end whereof made of arched Work, and imbowed over Head, ſeems to be very ancient. In ſhort, the Town is beautifull, well frequented, and full of fair Inns. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 3 Pariſh Churches; and its Market, which is on Saturdays, iis well ſerved with Corn, and other Proviſions.</p>
                        <p>As for honourary Titles, the firſt that had any from hence was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Viſcountels of <hi>Kynelmalky</hi> in Ireland, Created Counteſs of <hi>Guilford</hi> during life by Charles II. Anno 1660. Then in the Year 1671. the ſame King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Title of Earl of <hi>Guilford</hi> upon <hi>John Maitland,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> in Scotland.

                        <p>'Tis ſeated on the Banks of the River <hi>Avon,</hi> over which it has a well compact Stone-Bridge. A Town adorned with very fair Houſes, ſpacious and well ordered Streets, with a fine Market-houſe of free-Stone, ſuſtained by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pillars. It contains two fair Pariſh-Churches, of which S. Maries is the chief. Here is alſo, for the Education of Youth, a free School; and, for decay'd Gentlemen, a well indowed Hoſpital. But the chief Beauty of it, as heretofore ſo now, is a moſt ſtately and magnificent Caſtle, the Seat of Sir <hi>Fulk Grevill,</hi> the late Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> by whom it was repaired at his great coſt and charges. In ſhort, this Town injoy's a good Trade, chiefly for Mault; and the rather as being the Place where the Aſſizes and general Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the County are kept.

                        <p>But that which has added the moſt Luſtre to this Town is the honourary Titles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it has been dignify'd for ſeveral Ages.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49236:139"/>the Conquerour, Anno 1076; and continued in five more of his name, viz. <hi>Roger, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, Waleran, Henry,</hi> and <hi>Thomas de Newburg.</hi> From whom it paſſed through ſeveral Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, either by Marriage or Bloud allied to the former. Till at laſt the Title of Earl was by King Henry VI, turned into that of Duke in the perſon of <hi>Henry Beauchamp,</hi> who was made and crowned King of the Iſles of <hi>Wight, Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Garnſey,</hi> and ſoon after created Duke of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis true the Title of Duke went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that of Earl was renewed in the perſon of <hi>Richard Nevil,</hi> who married <hi>Ann</hi> the Duke's Siſter. From him it went to <hi>George,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who married <hi>Ann</hi> Daughter of <hi>Richard Nevil;</hi> and from <hi>George,</hi> to <hi>Edward Plantagenet,</hi> his Son. From theſe it came to two <hi>Dud eys</hi> ſucceſſively, to wit <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> deſcended from the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> And in the Year 1618. King James I. conferred it upon <hi>Robert,</hi> Lord <hi>Rich</hi> of <hi>Leeze;</hi> in whoſe Line it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till <hi>Charles</hi> his great Grandſon died without Iſſue. Upon whoſe Death, <hi>Robert Rich</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> his Couſin german, ſucceeded in the Earldom of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſo injoy'd both Titles. Which fell by his Death to his Son, the Right Honourable <hi>Edward Rich,</hi> the preſent Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi>

                        <p>Near Warwick is a Cliff, moſt delectably ſeated among Groves and freſh Streams; and called <hi>Guy-Cliff,</hi> from the Hercules of England, <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Who, having left off his noble and valiant Exploits, betook himſelf (as the Story ſay's) to this Place, where he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49236:139"/>led a kind of Hermetical Life, and built a Chappel wherein he was interred.</p>
                        <p>But, though Warwick be the County-Town, and a conſiderable Place upon other accounts; yet here is another of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which therefore doth deſerve a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deſcription in this place, before we proceed to the Liſt of the Market-Towns.

Thus Coventry, though within the Confines of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire, became exempted from its Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.

                           <hi>Bromicham</hi> is a large and well built Town, very populous, and much reſorted unto; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly noted, few years ago, for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Groats made here, and from hence diſperſed all over the Kingdom.

                        <p>To conclude, this County (which formerly was part of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and its Inhabitants part of the <hi>Cornavii,</hi> as the Romans called them) is now in the Dioceſe of <hi>Lichſield.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis bounded <hi>on the Eaſt</hi> with Yorkſhire, and the Biſhoprick of Darham; <hi>on the Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> with Cumberland; and <hi>on the South,</hi> with Lancaſhire. Which laſt does ſo interfere with <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> along the Sea-Coaſt, that this County has but one Corner to peep out upon the Sea; which is about the Place where the <hi>Ken</hi> falls into it.</p>
                        <p>It contains in <hi>Length,</hi> from North to South, about 35 miles; its <hi>Breadth,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, about 25.

                        </p>
                        <p>This County is very hilly, there being two ſeveral Ridges of high Hills, that croſs the Country as far as Cumberland. However it has, eſpecially in the Southern Parts, many fruitfull Valleys, with good Arable, Meadow, and Paſture-Grounds.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Air,</hi> by reaſon thoſe Hills and the Northern Situation of the Country, is very ſharp and piercing, and not ſo ſubject to the Fogs as many other Counties. Whereby the People are very healthfull, free from ſtrange and infectious Diſeaſes, and commonly live to a great Age.</p>

                        <p>As for <hi>Rivers,</hi> this County is very well watered.

                        <p>Here are alſo two noted <hi>Lakes,</hi> or Meers, the one called <hi>

From London to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> 181 miles, the particulars whereof you may ſee in <hi>Lancaſtire;</hi> and from Lancaſter to <hi>Kendall,</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>It is ſeated in a Dale, on the River <hi>Ken,</hi> whence it had the Name; built in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Croſs, two long and broad Streets thwarting one another, beſides ſome by-Streets. The ſame is a rich, populous, and well-traded Town; eſpecially for the making of woolen Cloth, Druggets, Serges, Hats, and worſted Stockings, whereby the poor people are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and the adjacent Parts inriched. Over the River it has two fair Stone-Bridges; beſides another of Wood, which leads to the Ruins of a Caſtle, the Birth-place of Queen
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49236:142"/>Catherine, the ſixth Wife to King Henry VIII. Here is a fair and large Church, to which (as the Pariſh-Church) belong 12 Chappels of Eaſe. And by the Church-yard ſtands a Free-School, being a large Building, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with good Exhibitions for poor Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, going from hence to Queens Colledge in Oxford. Here are alſo in this Town ſeven Companies, viz. the Mercers, Shearmen, Cordwainers, Tanners, Glovers, Taylors, and Pewterers, having their reſpective Halls for managing their Concerns. And, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, here is a great Market, which is kept on Saturdays.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this Town is an ancient Barony. Noted beſides for giving the Title of an Earl to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Regent of France; and to <hi>John de Foix,</hi> created Earl hereof by King Henry VI.</p>

                        <p>Now, before I proceed any further in my uſual Method, it will not be improper to take notice in this Place of two Remarkable Things in this County, viz. the <hi>Wanſdike,</hi> and <hi>Stone-henge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt is a Dike running for many miles from Weſt to Eaſt in the midſt of this Shire, and which (according to the vulgar Opinion) was caſt up by the Devil upon a Wedneſday, from whence the Name of <hi>Wanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike.</hi> But, as Cambden obſerveth, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made by the Weſt-Saxons, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of their Kingdom from that of the Mercians; this being the Place where they uſually fought, in order to ſtretch the Bounds of their Dominions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> the greater Wonder of the two, and indeed the moſt admirable Rarity this Iſland affords, is a ſtupendious Piece of Work. It conſiſts of huge Stones, ſtanding upright in three Ranks round like a Crown, and laid overthwart one another; ſome of which are 28 foot high, and 7 broad. Now the Queſtion is, how theſe Stones came hither. For the whole Country round for ſome miles hardly affords a Stone, either great or ſmall; and theſe ſeem too vaſt to be brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Wagon, Cart, or any other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Cambden therefore is of Opinion, that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49236:145"/>they were made there by Art, of pure Sand and ſome unctuous Cement, the Ancients having had the Art of making Stone. Thus the Ceſterns of Rome were made of Sand digged out of the Ground, which with the ſtrongeſt kind of Lime wrought together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo hard, that they ſeemed Stones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the chief Place of this County, is reckoned 70 miles Weſt-South-Weſt from London, thus. From London to <hi>New Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 8 miles; thence to <hi>Stanes,</hi> 7; to <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-row,</hi> 16 more; from thence to <hi>Baſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoke,</hi> 8; thence to <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> 10; to <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> 6 more; and from Andover to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>This is the City otherwiſe called <hi>New Sarum,</hi> raiſed out of an old one known to the Romans by the Name of <hi>Sorbiodunum,</hi> which was drily ſeated on a great Eminence, being a Place only deſigned for Strength. Yet it was for ſome time honoured with an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal See, and a fair Cathedral. As to the preſent City, 'tis pleaſantly ſeated among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rivers, whoſe Streams do commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly water moſt of the Streets; and almoſt incompaſſed with open Fields and Plains, which take their Name from it. In which Plains, about 6 miles diſtance, is to be ſeen the <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> as before deſcribed. In ſhort, this City for fair Buildings is inferiour to none, and tranſcends all others for the benefit of Water, almoſt every Street having a River running through the midſt thereof, among which the <hi>Avon</hi> is the principal. The Streets are large and ſpacious, accommodated with a fine Market-Place, and adorned with a fair Building, the Town-Hall. But the greateſt Ornament of this City, and indeed one of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49236:145"/>the principal Ornaments of England, is the Cathedral, a moſt ſtately and magnificent Church. Which, being begun by <hi>Richard Poore</hi> Biſhop of this See, and finiſhed in the Year 1258. by <hi>Bridport,</hi> the third Biſhop from him, was dedicated to the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin. This Church has 12 Gates, 52 Windows, and 365 Pillars great and ſmall; the firſt anſwering to the Number of Months, the ſecond to that of the Weeks, and the third to the Number of Days, in the Year. Its Steeple has a lofty Spire, which proudly ſhews it ſelf from a great diſtance. And (which is remarkable) an Imperial Crown ſtood at the very top of all, which by a ſudden Guſt of Wind was thrown down to the Ground at the very time when the late King James was at Salisbury, in order to oppoſe the Prince of Orange's Forces coming this way from the Weſt. Which two days after was followed by his Deſertion of that Place, and ſoon after by the Deſertion of the Crown and Government.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this City has been for ſeveral Ages honoured with the Title of an Earldom, 1. in the perſons of <hi>Patrick</hi> and <hi>William D'Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux,</hi> ſucceſſively. 2. In two <hi>Williams</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Long-Eſpèe,</hi> the firſt a baſe Son of King Henry II. by Roſamond. 3. In two <hi>Nevils,</hi> both <hi>Richards</hi> by their Chriſten-names. 4.

A Town ſtretched out from Eaſt to Weſt upon the aſcent of a Hill, watered by the Kennet, not far from the head of it; and having the conveniency both of a Foreſt and Chaſe in its Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the firſt called <hi>Savernake-Foreſt,</hi> and the

The Caſtle ſtill famous in our Law-Books for a Parliament there held in the Reign of King Henry III. in which were made the Statutes from hence called of <hi>Marleburgh,</hi> for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Tumults. But King Charles 1. at this Coronation made it yet more notable, in making it the Honour, as it was the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, of <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Ley,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, created by that King Earl of <hi>Marlbourough</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1625.

                           <hi>WORCESTERSHIRE,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land County, is bounded <hi>on the Eaſt</hi> by Warwickſhire, and part of Gloceſterſhire; <hi>on the Weſt,</hi> by Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and part of Shropſhire; <hi>on the North,</hi> by Staffordſhire; and <hi>on the South,</hi> by Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire.</p>
                        <p>It contains in <hi>Length,</hi> from North to South, about 35 miles; in <hi>Breadth,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, about 25. The Whole divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Hundreds,</hi> wherein 152 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and 11 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A County of an <hi>Air</hi> ſo temperate, and a <hi>Soil</hi> ſo fortunate, that it gives place to none about it, either for health or plenty. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant certainly it is in all ſorts of Fruits this Climate can afford, Pears and Cherries eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, inſomuch that here is made abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Perry. Here are alſo many Salt-pits, called <hi>Wiches,</hi> which yield excellent Salt, and ſuch as for whiteneſs and hardneſs imitateth Loaf-Sugar.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true this County is pretty full of Hills, but ſuch Hills as are not barren, yielding plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wood and ſtore of Paſturage; whilſt the Valleys on the other ſide feed abundance of Cattle, and bear good Crops of Corn.</p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:49236:149"/>
                        <p>Through theſe Valleys run ſo many Rivers, that few Counties are better watered with freſh Streams. Here we meet again that noble River, the <hi>Severn,</hi> which runs quite through the Country from North to South, and affords here great ſtore of freſh-Water Lampreys. Beſides the <hi>Avon,</hi> the <hi>Team,</hi> the <hi>Salwarp,</hi> &amp;c. which run into the Severn, and yield abundance of Fiſh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the chief Place hereof, and from whence the County is denominated, bears from London Weſt-North-Weſt, and is diſtant therefrom near upon 90 miles, thus. From London to <hi>Oxford</hi> 47 miles, as you may ſee afterwards in my Deſcription of Oxford; from thence to <hi>Chipping-Norton,</hi> 12; and to <hi>Campden,</hi> 12 more; thence to <hi>Perſhore,</hi> 10; and to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> 6 more.</p>
                        <p>Pleaſantly ſeated on the Eaſt Bank of the Severn, over which it has a fair Stone-Bridge with a Tower upon it, and thence ariſing with a gentle aſcent affords to the upper Parts a very goodly Proſpect in the Vale beneath. A City every way conſiderable, for Situation, neat Buildings, Number of Churches, and Wealth of the Inhabitants, by reaſon of their Cloth-Trade which does here flouriſh very much.</p>
                        <p>This City called by Antonine and Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy <hi>Branonium,</hi> and by the Romans <hi>Vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> is ſaid to have been firſt built by the Romans, the better to ſecure themſelves from the Britains beyond the Severn. But in the time of King Canute, it ſuftered much from the Danes, and afterwards by frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations, which laid it almoſt waſte, and deſpairing of a Recovery. Yet it roſe at laſt out of its Aſhes, and by degrees ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as to contain at preſent nine Pariſh-Churches,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49236:149"/>beſides the Cathedral. This is a ſtately Structure, in whoſe Quire are the Monuments of King John in white Marble, and of Arthur Prince of Wales, and Son to Henry VII. in blak Jeat. The Caſtle I ſhall ſay nothing of, as having nothing left of it but the Name and Ruins.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Worceſter</hi> is particularly memorable for the Battel fought there Sept. 3. 1651. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the late King Charles and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Forces, wherein the King's Army was totally defeated. So that he was fain to ſhift for himſelf, and to wander ſix Weeks in Diſguiſe about the Country, till he was at laft tranſported from a Creek near Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram in Suſſex to <hi>Feccam</hi> near <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> in France.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this City has a long time given the Title of Earl, and at laſt that of Marqueſs, to the Family of the <hi>Somerſets,</hi> extracted by the <hi>Beauforts</hi> from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt.</hi> For <hi>Charles Somerſet,</hi> who was created Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> by King Henry VIII, was baſe Son of <hi>Henry Beaufort,</hi> the 8th Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> beheaded in Edward the fourth's Reign.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly this City keeps 3 Markets a Week, viz. Wedneſdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.</p>

                           <hi>YORKSHIRE,</hi> a Maritime County, and the greateſt in the whole Kingdom, is bounded <hi>Eaſtward</hi> by the German Ocean; <hi>Weſtward,</hi> by Lancaſhire and Weſtmorland; <hi>Northward,</hi> by the ſaid Ocean, and the Biſhoprick of Durham, from which parted by the River Tees; and <hi>Southward,</hi> by Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby Shires.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Length,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, is 80 miles; its <hi>Breadth,</hi> from North to South, 70. The Whole divided firſt into three Parts, called <hi>Ridings,</hi> viz. the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt,</hi> and <hi>North Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Which together contain 26 <hi>Wapentakes</hi> or <hi>Hundreds,</hi> wherein 563 <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> and 49 <hi>Market-Towns.</hi> A ſmall number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes for ſuch an Extent of Ground, but that there are great many Chappels of Eaſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual for bigneſss and reſort of people to any Pariſh elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>East-Riding</hi> (which is by much the leaſt of the three) takes up only that part of Yorkſhire which lies between the River Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49236:151"/>went and the Sea. The <hi>North-Riding</hi> takes up the North Parts as far as Weſtmorland. And the <hi>Weſt-Riding,</hi> the largeſt of the three, is bounded on the North by the two former <hi>Ridings,</hi> on the South by the Counties of Derby, Nottingham, and Cheſhire, Eaſtward by Lincolnſhire, and Weſtward by Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Soil</hi> is generally fruitfull, in a very good meaſure. And, (as ſays <hi>Speed,</hi>) if one Part thereof is ſtony and barren Ground, another is as fertile and richly adorned with Corn and Paſturage. If here you find it naked and deſtitute of Woods, in other Places you ſhall find it ſhadowed with moſt ſpacious Foreſts. If it be ſomewhere mooriſh, miry, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, elſewhere it is as pleaſant as the Eye can wiſh.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Rivers,</hi> here are many of good note. For, beſides the <hi>Tees</hi> which parts this County from Durham, here you will find the <hi>Swale,</hi> the <hi>Youre,</hi> and the <hi>Nyd,</hi> of which the <hi>Ouſe</hi> at York is a Compound.

To which add the <hi>Dun,</hi> which ſevers part of this County from Lincolnſhire; and the <hi>Hull,</hi> which falls into the Humber at Hull. As for the <hi>Humber,</hi> which is the largeſt of all, it cannot be ſaid properly to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct River, but rather a Compound, or a Mouth, of ſeveral Rivers joyning into one Stream, as I have already hinted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Part.</p>

                        <p>A City which, for fame and greatneſs, is the ſecond City of England. It is in the <hi>North-Riding,</hi> ſituate on the River <hi>Ouſe,</hi> which divides it into two Parts, but joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſtately Stone-Bridge. Of which two Parts, that towards the Eaſt is the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, the Houſes ſtanding thicker, and the Streets narrower. In general, 'tis a fair, large, and beautifull City, adorned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair Buildings both publick and private, and incloſed with a ſtrong Wall, with ſeveral Turrets upon it. A City rich and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, well inhabited by Gentry and wealthy Tradeſmen, and containing about 30 Pariſh-Churches and Chappels, beſides its Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter. Firſt built by <hi>Edwyn,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of the Northumbers Anno 627, and finiſhed by King <hi>Oſwald</hi> his next Succeſſor but one. But, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſtroyed by Fire, and by the fury of the Danes, that which now ſtands was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the place thereof by Archbiſhop <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> the 25th of this See, and after by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees adorned and beautify'd by his Succeſſors. Of that magnificent Structure, which may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put her in the firſt Rank of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals in Europe.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, the Romans of old had this City in ſuch great eſteem, that <hi>Severus</hi> their Emperour had his Palace here, where he ended his Days. Here alſo, upon the Death of <hi>Fl. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Conſtantius,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Chlorus,</hi> his Son

                           <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was forthwith proclaimed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Nor did this City flouriſh only under the Romans, for it has been of as eminent Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in all Ages ſince; and in the ſeveral Turns and Changes which have befallen this Kingdom, under the Saxons, Danes, and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, has ſtill preſerved its ancient Luſtre. Adorned it was with an Archbiſhops See in the time of the Britains; nor ſtooped it low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when the Saxons imbraced the Goſpel. Richard II, laying unto it a little Territory on the Weſt-ſide thereof, made it a County Incorporate, as our Lawyers term it; in which the Archbiſhops of York injoy the Right of Palatines. It is governed, as Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by a Lord Mayor, London and York being the only Cities whoſe Mayors bear the Title of Lord. But not ſo much famed by that, as by the Title of Duke it has given to divers Princes of the Royal Bloud; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the late King James, before he came to the Crown.</p>

This River (which with a mighty noiſe runs here underneath the Town) was reputed very ſacred by the ancient Engliſh, for that in it <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the firſt Archbiſhop of York, baptized in one day above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, beſides Women and Children. The Town is of a ſmall Circuit in the Walls;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49236:157"/>but, by reaſon of its Suburbs lying out in length, very well peopled and frequented. Firſt built by <hi>Alane</hi> (Earl of Bretagne in France, and the firſt Earl of this Place) after the Entrance of the Normans. Who fenced it with a Wall, and a moſt ſtrong Caſtle, the better to ſecure theſe Parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Engliſh; and, having finiſhed the ſame, gave it the Name of <hi>Richmount,</hi> as a Place equally participating of ſtrength and beauty. As to its preſent ſtate, it contains two Pariſh-Churches, is graced with well-built Houſes, many of them of free-Stone, well inhabited by Gentry and Tradeſmen, and injoys a good Trade (for an Inland Town) for Stockings chiefty, and woollen Knit Caps for Seamen.</p>
                        <p>The Earls of Bretagne for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether continued in the Title and Poſſeſſion of this County; and ſince, it has been beſtowed upon other Families. In the Year 1641. <hi>James Stewart,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and Earl of <hi>March,</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> by King Charles I. <hi>Eſme,</hi> his Son, ſucceeded him; who died young, Anno 1660. Thus the Title fell to his Couſin german, <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Lichfield;</hi> who died without Iſſue Embaſſadour in Denmark, in the year 1672. And, within leſs than 3 years after, the Title was conferred by King Charles II, upon his Grace <hi>Charles Lenox,</hi> the preſent Duke of Richmond, his natural Son by the Dutcheſs of Portſmouth.</p>

Seated on a ſteep Rock, with ſuch craggy Cliffs, that it is almoſt Inacceſſible on every ſide; and waſhed by the Sea on all parts but the Weſt, where there is a narrow Paſſage, and that fenced with a ſtrong Wall. On the top of the Rock is a fair, green, and large Plain, containing above 60 Acres of Ground, with a freſh Water Spring iſſuing out of the Rock. Here was formerly a ſtately Tower which ſerved as a Land-Mark for Ships, but was demoliſhed in the long Civil Wars. At this time it is fortified with a ſtrong Caſtle, wherein a Garriſon is kept. The Town is not very large, but well built, and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; and, as it has a commodious Key, it injoy's a pretty good Trade. Several Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels belong unto this Town, imploy'd eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Herring-Fiſhing Seaſon, which are taken on this Coaſt in great plenty. This Place is alſo noted for its famous Spaw, which is much reſorted unto. But of late, in a more particular manner, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <hi>Richard Lumley,</hi> newly created Earl of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Between this Town and Whitby to the Northward is <hi>Robin Hoods Bay,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Robin-Hood,</hi> that noted Robber in the Reign of Richard I. About which is found a ſort of Jeat, or black Amber.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whitby,</hi> another Sea-Town, is commodiouſly ſeated on the River <hi>Esk,</hi> at its Influx into the Sea. A pretty neat Town, with a Bridge over the River, and driving a good Trade, chiefly for Allum and Butter. Here is a Cuſtom-Houſe, and great many Veſſels
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49236:158"/>belonging to the Town. Formerly a Place of note for its Abbey, but chiefly for the Abbeſs thereof, <hi>S. Hilda,</hi> ſo famed in her time for working of Miracles. One of which Tradition tells us was her ridding this Part of the Country of Snakes which infected it much, and conjuring of them into the Sea by her fervent Prayers. Which is backed by thoſe who aver, that at the Root of the craggy Rocks that are upon the Shore there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Stones ſcattered here and there, naturally as round as a Bullet. In which Stones, being broken, are found ſtony Serpents wrapt round, but moſt of them headleſs.</p>
                        <p>Not far from Whitby is <hi>Mulgrave,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Caſtle ſituate near unto the Sea, and firſt built in the Time of Richard II by <hi>Peter de Mauley.</hi> Who, being pleaſed with it, called it <hi>Mouligrace,</hi> that is, a fine Seat. But, as it proved a grievous Yoke to the neighbour In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, they nicknamed it, and called it <hi>Moultgrave,</hi> ſince turned into <hi>Mulgrave,</hi> by which Name it go's to this day. It continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Line for 7 Generations, and all of them called <hi>Peters</hi> too. The Iſſue male failing, it paſſed through ſeveral Families, till it came to the <hi>Sheffields.</hi> Out of which Houſe <hi>Edmund,</hi> Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> of <hi>Butterwick,</hi> Lord Preſident of the North, was created Earl of <hi>Mulgrave</hi> by King Charles I. Anno 1625. To whom ſucceeded in the Title <hi>Edmund,</hi> his Grand-Son by Sir <hi>John Sheffield</hi> his ſecond Son. Who dying in the Year 1658. left his Title to his Son and Heir, the Right Honourable <hi>John Sheffield,</hi> the preſent Earl of <hi>Mulgrave.</hi>

                        <p>Some miles Weſt from Mulgrave Caſtle is a ſmall Sea-Town, called <hi>Skeningrave;</hi> not to be omitted, were it but for the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Seal-fiſh. Hereabouts near unto Hunt-Cliff, at low Water, appear Rocks not far from the Shore, about which the Seal-fiſh come in great Sholes, and in fair and warm Weather ly ſleeping and ſunning themſelves. But, as it has been obſerved, while they ly thus aſleep, one of them is upon the Watch, and acts the part of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel. Who, upon the appearance of any Danger, gives the Signal by flouncing into the Water, the Noiſe whereof awakes the reſt, and ſo they make their eſcape. They are not afraid (ſay's my Author) of Women, but only of Men; and therefore they that catch 'em put on Womens Cloaths. If, when they are chaſed, they find themſelves too far from the Water, their Way is with their hinder feet to fling Sand and Gravel backward in the Purſuers faces, which forces 'em ſometimes to quit the Sport.</p>
                        <p>Some miles from this Coaſt to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is a Tract of Land, called <hi>Cleveland,</hi> taking that Name (as Cambden tells us) of the Cliffs, or ſteep Banks, which run all along the ſide thereof, and at the foot of which the Country ſpreads it ſelf into a fine fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plain. A Territory beſides of a good extent, which gave the Title of an Earl to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> created Earl of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by King Charles I. But, leaving no Iſſue, the Title died with him, Anno 1670. King Charles II. conferred the Title of Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleveland</hi> upon <hi>Barbara Villiers,</hi> Daughter to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Grandiſon</hi> who was ſlain in the Civil Wars, the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain's</hi>
                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49236:159"/>Wife, and Mother of three Dukes, viz. the Duke of <hi>Southampton,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this Tract (I mean <hi>Cleveland</hi>) is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Caſtle, called <hi>Danby,</hi> ſeated near unto a large Park, and a goodly Chaſe of the ſame Name. It belonged anciently to the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> and was ſold (with other Lands belonging to that Family) to <hi>Ralph Nevil,</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> who forthwith gave the ſame to his Son Sir <hi>George Nevil.</hi> And, not long after, King Henry VI. ſummoned him to the Parliament by the Name of Lord <hi>Latimer.</hi> Whoſe Iſſue male failing in Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths Time, the Eſtate was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two Daughters. The Caſtle, with the Lands adjoyning, fell to the ſhare of <hi>Mary,</hi> Wife to <hi>Sir John Danvers</hi> of Wiltſhire. By whom ſhe got Sir <hi>Henry Danvers,</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by King James I. Lord <hi>Danvers</hi> of <hi>Danby,</hi> and by King Charles I. Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> But he, dying without Iſſue, the Title lay dormant, till revived by Charles II. By whom the Right Honourable <hi>Thomas Oſborn,</hi> now Marqueſs of <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> was created Baron of <hi>Kineton,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Latimer,</hi> in the Year 1673, and Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> the next Year.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gisborough</hi> is pleaſantly ſeated in a Flat, between Mulgrave and the River Tees. A mean Town to what it was, when it had its rich Abbey; but of ſome note however, for being the firſt place where Allum was made in England. Not far from which is <hi>Roſeberry-Topping,</hi> a Hill Pyramid-like, ſerving to Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for a Land-Mark, and being to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-people a certain Sign of Rain, when they ſee a Cloud over it. Almoſt at the top of it is a Spring of Water coming out of a huge Rock, counted good for ſore Eyes.</p>

                           <hi>Stokeſley</hi> is a Market-Town well watered with freſh Streams. <hi>Yarum,</hi> but a mean Town, is ſeated on the <hi>Tees,</hi> which divides this County from the Biſhoprick of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and over which it has a fair Stone-Bridge. <hi>North-Allerton,</hi> a large Borough-Town, ſtands near the <hi>Wisk,</hi> a ſmall Stream that falls into the Swale. And <hi>Thirsk</hi> is a ſmall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Town that had once a very ſtrong Caſtle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bedal, Middleham,</hi> and <hi>Maſham</hi> are all three in Richmondſhire.

The firſt, a Borough-Town, is ſeated on the Banks of the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> over which it has a Stone-bridge; and contains 3 Pariſh Churches, being well-inhabited, and accommodated with good Inns for Travellers. Its Market on Saturdays is counted one of the beſt in all the County for Horſes, living Cattle, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and moſt Country-Commodities, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Tools for Husbandry. The other three are all ſeated on ſmall Rivers, which after ſome ſmall Courſe joyn together into one Stream, and ſo fall into the <hi>Derwent,</hi> a little below New Malton.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants Part of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans called them,) is now in the Dioceſe of <hi>York.</hi>

                        <p>Thus I have compaſſed a very difficult Task, the Deſcription of forty Counties, with ſo much variety of Matter, in ſo ſhort a Compaſs.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of <hi>LONDON</hi> and <hi>WEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINSTER.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Joyn theſe two together, becauſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. And, tho' they be two diſtinct Cities, both by their Foundation and diſtinct Government; yet, as they make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one compact Body, the City of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, under that Notion, is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Name of London, and lookt upon as a Part of it. In the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption whereof, I ſhall joyn and part them, as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
                     <p>My Deſign is not to make a long Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the uncertain <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>LONDON,</hi> which (as ſome write) was built above eleven hundred Years before the Birth of our Saviour.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49236:161"/>That it is a moſt ancient City, is a thing paſt all doubt. For Hiſtory tells us, that the Britiſh King <hi>Lud,</hi> above 60 Years before our Saviours Birth, repaired and improved it. The Romans, in whoſe Time it was an Archbiſhop's See, gave it the Title of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta.</hi> And Animianus Marcellinus, who wrote near 1300 Years ago, calls it then an ancient City.</p>
                     <p>As for its <hi>Name,</hi> the moſt probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture in my Judgment is that of thoſe who derive it from the Britiſh Word <hi>Llongdin,</hi> a Town of Ships.</p>
                     <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is, upon all accounts, very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, whether we conſider the Soil on which it ſtands, the River that waters it, the Fruitfulneſs of the Country about it, the Roads that lead into it, or its convenient Diſtance from the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Soil is gravelly, and therefore ſo much the wholſomer. And, as it ſtands upon a gentle riſing Bank, on the North-ſide of the River, this adds much to the healthfulneſs of the Place; the South-ſide being counted ſomething unhealthy by reaſon of the Vapours the Sun draws upon it.</p>
                     <p>The Thames that waters it I have already deſcribed, as the chief River of England, and an excellent navigable River. This City ſtands where the River is caſt into the form of a Creſcent; and ſtretches it ſelf in length along the Shore, as Cologne does upon the Rhine. Which is a great Advantage, upon ſeveral Accounts, eſpecially to a great City Firſt, becauſe it ly's the more convenient for the ſeveral Uſes and Benefits of the River. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the Freeneſs of the Air; which makes it ſo much the healthfuller; lying open
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49236:162"/>to the Fields Northward, and to the River Southward. Whereas Paris, and all other Cities of an orbicular Form, ly cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the middle Parts half choackt for want of Air. To which add another Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency in London by its Situation along the River, that by the Courſe of it one may ſooner find out any Place than is poſſible in Paris, which is a very Labyrinth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
                     <p>This River beſides is full of excellent Fiſh, ſuch as Barbels, Trouts, Chevins, Pearches, Smelts, Breams, Roaches, Daces, Gudgeons, Flounders, Shrimps, Eels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, after the Smelt-time is paſt, it yields alſo ſweet Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But Carps it is ſcarce of, except up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Land-flouds, when they get out of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Ponds. Great number of Swans are daily ſeen upon this River. Beſides a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Motion of Wherries and ſmall Boats, above 2000 in Number, whereby 3000 Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are maintained, by carrying Goods and Paſſengers thereon. Not counting thoſe large Tilt-Boats, Tide-Boats, and Barges, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry People, or bring Proviſion from moſt Parts of the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>For Navigation, no River more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as may appear by a Paſſage in the Reign of King James I. Who, being diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the City, for refuſing to lend him a Sum of Mony he required, threatned the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that he would remove his Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall, to another Place, with further expreſſions of his Indignation. Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, anſwered the Lord Mayor calmly, may
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49236:162"/>do what you pleaſe therein, and your City of London will prove ſtill dutifull; but ſhe comforts her ſelf with the Thoughts, that your Majeſty will leave the Thames behind you.</p>
                     <p>This River beſides is ſo Kind, that it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom indamages any Part of this City by its Overflowings. Here the higheſt Tides are upon a Land-floud, and the Moon at full, when ſometimes it does ſwell over its Banks. But then Weſtminſter, lying low, feels alone the effects of it, and that ſeldom further than the Cellars. Whereas the Chambers and Upper Rooms at Rome and Paris are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overflowed, Rome by the Tiber, and Paris by the Seine.</p>
                     <p>From this River the City, by Water-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, is in many places ſupplied with good Water. But, to ſerve with Water the North Parts of the City, as the Thames does the South Parts, it has the Conveniency of an artificial River, commonly called the <hi>New River,</hi> which was begun Anno 1608, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in five Years time. A noble Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> who for this great Work deſerves his Statue in Braſs. This River he brought from Amwell and Chad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, two Springs near <hi>Ware</hi> in Hartfordſhire; from whence, in a turning and winding Courſe, it runs near upon 60 miles, before it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es this City. In this Undertaking, fitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a Prince than any Subject, there have been ſix hundred Men at once imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was a prodigious Charge. The Channel in ſome Places 30 foot deep, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers carried over Valleys 20 foot at leaſt above Ground, in open Troughs. And over this River are 800 Bridges, ſome of Stone,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49236:163"/>ſome of Wood, and others of Brick.</p>
                     <p>This City beſides has the Conveniency of ſeveral Conduits of Spring-Water, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly placed, that they ſerve all the chief Parts of it. And it is ſo ſituated, that in all Parts (though on the higheſt Ground) 'tis abundantly ſerved with Pump-Water, the Pumps in many Places not ſix foot deep in the Ground.</p>
                     <p>For a conſtant Supply of Proviſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fruitfull County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in which it ſtands, and that of <hi>Surrey</hi> on the other ſide of the River (both which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand to furniſh it with their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) it is neighboured with many other plentifull Counties, out of whoſe abundance this City lives in great plenty, and ſeldom knows what Scarcity is.</p>
                     <p>The Conveyance ſo eaſy, both by Land and Water, that no City in Europe has bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conveniencies. So large, fair, and ſmooth are the High Ways that lead from all Parts to it, and ſo convenient is the River, that almoſt all the Fewel for firing is brought up that Way to Town. The Coals from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, and the Wood from Kent and Eſſex; ſome of which laſt comes alſo down the River from Surrey and Middleſex. Laſtly, as it has the Command of the Sea, ſo there is ſcarce any Bleſſing in the Terreſtrial Globe but this City has her Share in it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, its Diſtance from the Sea (which is about 60 Miles) is a great Argument of the Founder's Wiſdom. For, by that Diſtance, as it is not ſo near as to be annoyed by the unwholſom Vapours of the Sea, or to be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurpriſed by an Enemies Fleet; ſo it is not ſo far but that, by the help of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49236:163"/>Tide (which comes up every 12 hours) Ships of great burden may be brought into her boſom.</p>
                     <p>In point of Latitude, 'tis in 51 Degree, 30 Minutes.</p>
                     <p>I come now to its full <hi>Extent,</hi> with its Suburbs and Places adjacent. Its Length from Eaſt to Weſt, that is, from Lime-houſe to the further end of Mill-Bank in Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is above 7500 Geometrical Paces, which comes to ſeven meaſured miles and an half, at 1000 paces a mile; that is, about five computed miles, or two Pariſian Leagues and a half. The Breadth indeed is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, the City being built in Length for the Conveniency of the River. And yet, taking Southwark in on the other ſide of the River, as it is under the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Juriſdiction, and joyned to London by the Bridge, this vaſt City reaches there in Breadth, from North to South, that is, from the further end of White-Chappel Street to St. George's Fields in Southwark, near upon 3 miles. So that I cannot but conceive that, if London were caſt (as Paris) into an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular Form, the Circumference of it would be much larger than that of Paris. So much it is increaſed in Buildings, ſince the diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration in the Year 1666.</p>
                     <p>But whether it is profitable to the Body of the State or not, to have ſo vaſt a Head, may be made a Queſtion. And, if Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> had cauſe to complain in his time of its being grown then too big for the Kingdom, he might with much more reaſon do it now. Great Towns, ſays he, in the Body of a State are like the Spleen or Milt in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy natural. The monſtrous Growth of which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49236:164"/>impoveriſhes all the reſt of the Members, by drawing to it all the animal and vital Spirits which ſhould give nouriſhment unto them; and in the end cracked or ſurcharged by its own fulneſs, not only ſends unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Fumes and Vapours to the Head, and heavy Pangs upon the Heart, but draws a Conſumption on it ſelf. He adds further, that the Overgrowth of great Cities is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence, not only in regard of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſuch Multitudes of Mouths not being eaſy to be fed; but in reſpect of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Danger of Inſurrections, if once thoſe Multitudes, ſenſible of their own Strength, oppreſſed with Want, or otherwiſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Faction or Diſcontent, ſhould gather to a head, and break out into Action.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all, I confeſs, very plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. But, if we conſider <hi>London</hi> as it is in a manner the Head of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, at leaſt the Seat of their Monarch, I ſee nothing of Monſtrouſneſs in it. On the other ſide, <hi>London</hi> having the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Sea and of a navigable River, is ſo much the leſs ſubject to a Famine; for that in caſe of Scarcity at home, it may be ſupply'd from abroad. And, as in ſo great a Body there be commonly different Parties led by oppoſite Intereſts, ſo there is the leſs Cauſe to fear Inſurrections, becauſe one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keeps ſtill another in aw. Juſt ſo <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Hamburg,</hi> two free Cities, do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo much by their own Strength, as by the Jealouſy of the ſeveral States that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour upon 'em.</p>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:49236:164"/>
                     <p>But the greateſt Danger incident to great Cities (and omitted by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) is in Caſe of Contagious Diſeaſes; Which, the more Matter they find to work upon, make ſo much the greater havock; and like a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Fire, get ſtrength by their Motion. Witneſs the Year 1665, when at <hi>London</hi> there died of the Plague in one day no leſs than 1200.</p>
                     <p>When all is done, I have this to urge in the behalf of great Cities, that they are a viſible Sign of a flouriſhing State, and ſuch as draws Reſpect from its Neighbours, who look upon it as the Luxuriancy and Reſult of its Wealth. And, of all the Cities of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, none can ſo juſtly challenge the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency in this Point as <hi>London,</hi> the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of England; being not only perhaps the moſt ancient, but alſo the wealthieſt, and (reckoning all its Annexes) the greateſt City now extant in Europe.</p>
                     <p>Such a City as contains above 600 Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys; and in them all, by a late Computation, at leaſt a hundred thouſand Houſes. So that, allowing only 8 Perſons to each Houſe one with another, (which I think is moderate) the Number of the Inhabitants will amount at that rate to above eight hundred thouſand Souls. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides a World of Seamen, that live and ſwarm in that conſtant (tho' moving) Foreſt of Ships down the River, on the Eaſt ſide of the Bridge.</p>
                     <p>The Dwelling Houſes raiſed ſince the Fire are generally very fair, and built much more convenient and uniform than heretofore. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire, they were moſt Timber Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, built with little regard to Uniformity;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49236:165"/>but ſince the Fire, Building of Bricks has been the general Way, and that with ſo much Art and Skill in Architecture, that I have often wondered to ſee in well-compact Houſes ſo many Conveniences in a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Ground. In ſhort, our Engliſh Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have built ſo much of late Years, that no Nation perhaps at this time can vy with them for making much of any Ground (tho' never ſo little) and contriving all the Parts of it to the beſt advantage, in the neateſt and moſt regular way, with all the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the Ground can poſſibly afford. And that which adds much to the Neatneſs of the late Buildings is the Wainſcot, now ſo much in uſe. Which, as it is the cleaneſt Furniture, ſo it is the moſt durable, and indeed the moſt proper for ſo moiſt a Country.</p>
                     <p>If we come to Statelineſs, I confeſs the Noblemens Houſes at Paris, being built of free Stone (as moſt of that City are) with large Courts before 'em for the Reception of Coaches, make a fine outward Appearance. But, for uniformity, ſtate, and magnificence, we have ſome here, and chiefly <hi>Montague-Houſe,</hi> that exceed by far moſt of 'em. As for great Merchants Houſes, and fair Taverns, ſcarce any City ſurpaſſeth London in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. For publick Buildings, as Halls, Inns of Court, Exchanges, Market-Places, Hoſpitals, Colledges, Churches, beſides the Bridge upon the River, the Monument, Cuſtom-Houſe, and the Tower, they are Things worth any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Curioſity to view, at leaſt a good part of them. Moſt of which have indeed the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being built backward, and out of the way, to make room for Tradeſmens Shops in the Streets. Whereas, if they had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49236:165"/>been all built towards the Street, as generally they are in other Countries, few Cities could make ſo great an Appearance.</p>
                     <p>But for ſtately, ſtrait, and ſpacious Streets, (to paſs by many curious Courts) where ſhall one ſee finer than <hi>Cheapſide, Cornhill, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What forein City can ſhew ſo many <hi>Piazzas,</hi> or fine Squares, ſuch as <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Lincolns-Inn-Square, Grays-Inn, Red Lion,</hi> and <hi>Southampton-Squares,</hi> the <hi>Golden Square, King's Square</hi> in Sohoe, <hi>S. James's Square, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-Fields,</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> The firſt of which is chiefly noted for its Spaciouſneſs, and <hi>King's Square</hi> for its Statelineſs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, when I reflect upon that diſinal Fire, which in three Days time conſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirteen thouſand Houſes (beſides 89 Pariſh Churches, the vaſt Cathedral of S. Paul, divers Chappels, Halls, Colledges, Schools, and other publick Edifices) it is a matter of amazement to me to ſee how ſoon the Engliſh recovered themſelves from ſo great a Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Loſs not to be computed. At 3 Years end near upon ten thouſand Houſes were raiſed up again from their Aſhes, with great Improvements. And by that time the fit of Building grew ſo ſtrong, that, beſides a full and glorious Reſtauration of a City that a raging Fire had lately buried in its Aſhes, the Suburbs have been increaſed to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that (to ſpeak modeſtly) as many more Houſes have been added to it, with all the Advantages that able and skilfull Builders could invent, both for Conveniency and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:49236:166"/>
                     <p>But it is time to come to Particulars The City, properly ſo called, is begirt with a <hi>Wall,</hi> which gives entrance at ſeven prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Gates,</hi> beſides <hi>Posterns</hi> of later erection Viz. on the Weſt-ſide <hi>Ludgate</hi> and <hi>Newgate,</hi> both which ſerve for Priſons; the firſt, for ſuch Debtors as are Freemen of the City the other for Malefactors both of the City and Country, and is beſides the County Goa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Within the Compaſs of the Walls there are reckoned 97 Pariſhes; and in relation to the Civil Government, the City within the Walls and Freedom is divided into 26 Wards or Aldermanries, of which more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>As to the publick Buildings here, I ſhall begin with the <hi>Tower,</hi> a Fort upon the Thames, which commands both the City and River. Called the Tower, from the great white Tower in the middle, which gives Name to the Whole. 'Tis all ſurrounded with a Wall and Ditch about a mile in compaſs, with Cannon planted on the Walls, and the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets thereof. But it is beſides the principal Store-houſe of England for Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, ſuch as is ſaid to contain Arms for about 60000 Men.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo kept the Jewels and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Crown, and the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Nation. As among others, the Original of all the Laws that have been enacted or recorded till the Reign of Richard II. The Grants of ſeveral Kings to their Subjects at home and abroad, and

The Homage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of Scotland upon England. The Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Ireland in Laws and Dominions. Theſe, and many other Records, are repoſited in <hi>Wakefield Tower,</hi> near the Traytors Gate, under the Cuſtody of an Officer, called the <hi>Keeper of the Records,</hi> and whoſe Salary is 500 <hi>

                     <p>But, whether the Tower be in the County (that is under the Juriſdiction) of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, or in the Liberty of the City, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to this day.

                     <q>In the Year of Chriſt 1666, the ſecond Day of September, Eaſtward from hence, at the Diſtance of Two hundred and two foot (the height of this Column) a terrible Fire broke out about Midnight; which driven on by a high Wind, not only waſted the adjacent Parts, but alſo very remote Places, with incredible noiſe and fury. It conſumed eighty nine Churches, the City-Gates, Guildhall, many publick Structures, Hoſpitals, Schools, Libraries, a vaſt Number of ſtately Edifices, Thirteen thouſand two hundred Dwelling-houſes, four hundred Streets. Of the ſix and twenty Wards it utterly deſtroy'd fifteen, and left eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhattered and half-burnt. The Ruins of the City were four hundred thirty ſix Acres, from the Tower by the Thames-ſide to the Temple-Church, and from the North-Eaſt Gate along the City-Wall to Holborn-Bridge. To the Eſtates and Fortunes of the Citizens it was mercileſs, but to their Lives very favourable, that it might in all things reſemble the laſt Conflagration of the World. The Deſtruction was ſudden, for in a ſmall ſpace of time the ſame City was ſeen moſt flouriſhing, and reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal Fire had baffled all humane Counſels and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the Opinion of all, it ſtopt as it were by a Command from Heaven, and was on every ſide extinguiſhed.</q>

                     <q>Charles II. Son of Charles the Martyr, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, a moſt gracious Prince, Commiſerating the deplorable ſtate of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49236:170"/>Things, whilſt the Ruins were yet ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, provided for the Comfort of his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and the Ornament of his City; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their Taxes, and referred the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Magiſtrates and Inhabitants to the Parliament; who immediately paſſed an Act, that publick Works ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to greater Beauty with publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to be raiſed by an Impoſition on Coals; That Churches and the Cathedral of S. Paul's ſhould be Rebuilt from their Foundations, with all Magnificence; That Bridges, Gates, and Priſons ſhould be new made, the Sewers cleanſed, the Streets made ſtrait and regular, ſuch as were ſteep le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and thoſe too narrow made wider; Markets and Shambles removed to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Places. They alſo Enacted, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Houſe ſhould be built with Party Walls, and all in Front raiſed of equal height, and thoſe Walls all of ſquare Stone or Brick, and that no man ſhould delay Building be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſpace of ſeven Years. Moreover, Care was taken by Law, to prevent all Suits about their Bounds. Alſo anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Prayers were injoyned; and, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the Memory hereof to Poſterity, they cauſed this Column to be erected. The Work was carried on with diligence, and London is reſtored; but, whether with greater ſpeed or beauty, may be made a queſtion. At three years time the World ſees that finiſhed, which was ſuppoſed to be the Buſineſs of an Age.</q>
                     <p>From the Monument I come now to the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> the fineſt Building of this kind in Europe. Firſt erected in the year
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49236:171"/>1566 (juſt one hundred years before it was burnt) at the Coſt and Chargers of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Merchant, Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham;</hi> and, by the ſpecial Command of Queen Elizabeth, proclaimed in a ſolemn manner by the Name of the <hi>Royal-Exchange.</hi> But then it was built moſt of Brick; and now all of free-ſtone within and without, with admirable Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is Quadrangular, with a ſtately Front to it, and a high Turret at the top, with a Chime of 12 Bells. Within is a large Court, wherein the Merchants meet daily about one a Clock; and all round it fine arched Galleries or Walks, for a Shelter in caſe of Rain, or hot Sun-ſhiny Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Court ſtands a fine Statue of white Marble, upon a Pedeſtal 7 foot high. 'Tis the Statue of King Charles II, done with great beauty and ſpirit in the ancient Habit of the Roman Caeſars, with a Wreath of Laurel on his Head. The Work of Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> (a moſt skilfull Artiſt,) at the charge of the Merchant Adventurers of England.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Ornament of this Place is in the Niches above, where the Kings of England from William the Conquerour are now partly ſet up, till the reſt can be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Above Stairs is the Exchange, chiefly for wearing Apparel. It conſiſts of almoſt 200 Shops, where the richeſt ſort of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſold, both for Uſe and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The whole Fabrick coſt above 50000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> whereof one half being disburſed by the Chamber of London, and the other by the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49236:171"/>Company of Mercers, they now reimburſe themſelves by the Rent of the Shops above and below Stairs, and the vaulted Cellars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground. Which comes to about 4000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year, beſides 30 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> Fine, which is paid for every Shop. And, as Dr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, this goodly Fabrick not taking up quite an Acre of Ground, is perhaps the richeſt piece of Ground in the whole World.</p>
                     <p>In our Way towards Weſtminſter, before we come to St. Pauls Cathedral, are three Things worth taking notice of. On the left hand, a <hi>Statute</hi> of King Charles II. on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in Stock-Market, with a fine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit to it, <hi>Bow ſteeple</hi> in the middle of Cheapſide, and on the right hand the <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> The firſt done in white Marble, at the Coſt and Charges of Sir Robert Viner. The other a ſolid and beautifull Structure, compoſed of four of the Orders of Building, which ſhews the rare Invention of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect. The whole Height of it from the Ground is 225 foot, and yet is but half ſo high as the intended Dome of St. Pauls Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral is deſigned to be. Noted beſides for its Ring of Bells, reputed to be the beſt in all England. <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where the the City Courts of Judicature are held; and where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council meet for the Management of the City-Concerns, is a ſpacious Building, but more glorious within than without. At the firſt coming in is a ſpacious Hall, ſet out (among other Things) with the Pictures of Their Majeſties King William and Queen Mary, with thoſe of ſeveral Judges. Here are alſo two Giauts, that ſtand up in their bulky Figures.</p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:49236:172"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> is ſo near this Place, and ſo famous for the Sale of Woollen-Cloths, that I cannot paſs it by in Silence. The ſame was purchaſed by the Lord Mayor and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty in the Beign of Richard II, and has been ſince imployed as a Weekly Market-Place for all ſorts of Woollen-Cloth, broad and narrow, brought from all Parts of the Kingdom there to be ſold. And it is to this day the greateſt Market and Store-houſe for all ſorts of Woolen-Cloth.</p>
                     <p>And now we come to St. <hi>Pauls Cathedral,</hi> ſeated on the higheſt Part of all the City, and firſt built by Sebert, the firſt Chriſtian King of the Eaſt-Saxons. Before the Fire it was in Length 690 Foot, that is 20 foot long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than St. Peter's in Rome, which for beauty, proportion, and divers other Things, excels all other Churches. Its Breadth and Height were proportionable to the Length, ſo that it ſtood upon ſo much ground as contained above 3 Acres and a half. This famous Church, as vaſt and ſolid as it was, was devoured by that dreadfull Fire in the Year 1666. But, ſome Years after, Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Wren</hi> having, by the King's Command, deſigned a new Model of it, a new Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was laid accordingly. And, ever ſince, this ſtately Fabrick has been carried on to that height we ſee it now. So that for Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Figure, for Solidity, Magnificence, and curious-Architecture, 'tis like to excel all Churches in Chriſtendom, except in ſome particulars St. Peter's Church in Rome. To this Cathedral belongs a Dean, and thirty Prebendaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Thoſe are Utter-Barriſters, who from their Learning and Standing are called by the Benchers, in the Mooting Time, to plead and argue Moots, that is doubtfull Caſes and Queſtions. And, whilſt they argue the ſaid Caſes, they ſit uttermoſt on the Forms of the Benchers. Out of theſe Mootmen, are choſen Readers for the Inns of Chancery, where in Term-Time and Grand Vacations they argue Caſes in the preſence of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Clerks. In the four Inns of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery ſeated in Holbourn, the Moots are read either by thoſe of Grays-Inn, or Lincolns-Inn; and in the others, by thoſe of the two Temples.</p>
                     <p>The Benchers, ſo called from the Bench whereon they ſit at the upper end of the Hall, are the Seniors, to whom is committed the Government of the whole Houſe; and out of whoſe Number is yearly choſen a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, who receives, disburſes, and accounts for all Moneys belonging to the Houſe.

                     <p>The Manner of their Choice is thus. When the Number of Sergeants is ſmall, the Lord Chief-Juſtice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and conſent of the other Judges, makes choice of ſome of the moſt grave and learned of the Inns of Court, and preſents their Names to the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper. Who ſends, by the King's Writ, to each of them, to appear on ſuch a day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, to receive the State and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Sergeant at Law. At the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Time, they, being habited in party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured Robes, come to Weſtminſter-Hall, accompany'd with the Students of the Inns of Court, and attended by a Train of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Retainers in their Cloth Liveries. Where they take in publick a ſolemn Oath, and are cloathed with Coifs, which they wear always in publick. After this, they feaſt the great Perſons of the Nation in a moſt ſplendid manner, and preſent them with gold Rings, according to their Quality. Out of theſe Sergeants the King calls by Writ ſome of them to be of his Council at Law. Theſe fit within the Bar in all Courts at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, except in the Common-Pleas.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inns of Court</hi> are ſo called, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Students therein are to ſerve the Courts of Judicature, or elfe (as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> affirms) becauſe theſe Colledges received only the Sons of Noblemen and better ſort of Gentlemen. They are the largeſt and the moſt beautiful Inns; <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> particularly being beautify'd of late with a fine Square,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49236:174"/>and another being now building in <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> which will be a great Set-off and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it.</p>

Which Houſe was part of the Knights Templers, and called the <hi>Outer-Temple,</hi> becauſe ſeated without Temple-Bar.</p>

                        <hi>Lincolns Inn</hi> is ſo called from the ancient Earls of Lincoln, whoſe Houſe it was; and <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> from the noble Family of the Grays, to whom it formerly belonged.</p>
                     <p>In theſe four Inns of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inns of Chancery</hi> were heretofore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Colledges for younger Students; where they were uſually entred, before they could be admitted into the Inns of Court. Now they are for the moſt part taken up by Attorneys, Sollicitors, and Clerks; who have here their Chambers apart, and their Diet at an eaſy rate. Here they eat in a Hall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where they are obliged to appear in their Robes, and black round knit Caps.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Inns belong to the Inns of Court, ſome to one, ſome to another. As <hi>Bernard's</hi> and <hi>Staple-Inns</hi> to Grays Inn, <hi>Thavies</hi> and <hi>Furnival's</hi> to Lincolns-Inn, and the reſt to the two Temples. Accordingly the Inns of Court ſend yearly ſome of their Barriſters to Read in thoſe Colledges, all which one with another contain about 500 Lawyers.</p>

                     <p>But, beſides thoſe 8 Inns of Chancery, there is another in Chancery-Lane, known by the Name of <hi>Symonds Inn,</hi> being formerly a publick Inn kept by one <hi>Symond.</hi> This is an Inn by it ſelf, belonging to no Inn of Court, nor liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any Rules, ſuch as the other Inns live under.</p>
                     <p>Now 'tis to be obſerved, that the foreſaid Societies are no Corporations, and have no Judicial Power over their Members. Only they have among themſelves certain Orders, which by Conſent have the force of Laws. Neither have they any Lands or Revenues, as Societies; and, for the defraying the Charges of the Houſe, they have but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-rents for their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

                     <p>But London being in a manner an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, there are in it ſeveral other Colledges worth our taking notice.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the <hi>Colledge of Phyſicians,</hi> which ſtood formerly in Knight-Rider Street; and was the Gift of Dr. <hi>Linacre,</hi> Phyſician to King Henry VIII. Since which a Houſe and Ground was purchaſed by the Society of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians at the end of Amen-Street, whereon a ſtately Structure for a Library and a public<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Hall was erected by Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Anno 1652. who indowed the ſame with his whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which he reſigned while he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> yet living and in health. But this goodly Edifice could not eſcape the rage of the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Fire. And that Ground being but a Leaſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49236:175"/>the Society purchaſed a Piece of Ground in Warwick Lane near Newgate, whereon they have raiſed the preſent Colledge, a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Edifice.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſicians of this Colledge have, by Charters and Acts of Parliament, ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges as exclude all others (though Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates in Phyſick, of Oxford or Cambridge) from practiſing Phyſick in London, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 7 miles of it, without a Licence under the Colledge-Seal. And all Offenders in that Caſe, and divers others, they may fine, and impriſon. They have Authority to ſearch all the Shops of Apothecaries in and about London, to ſee if their Drugs and Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are wholſom and well made. And, by virtue of the ſaid Charters, they are freed from all troubleſom Offices, as to ſerve upon Juries, to be Conſtable, to keep Watch and Ward, to bear Arms, or provide Arms or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This Colledge do's chiefly conſiſt of Fellows and Candidates; beſides the honourary Fellows, and Licentiates. The Number of <hi>Fellows</hi> is always to be forty, beſides the King's Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. And, when any Fellow dies, or leaves this City, the next Candidate ſucceeds to make up the Number. But the <hi>Candidates,</hi> before their Admiſſion, are ſtrictly examined (or at leaſt ought to be ſo) in all Parts of Phyſick. The <hi>honourary Fellows</hi> and <hi>Licentiates</hi> do both injoy the Priviledges of the Colledge, but have no ſhare in the Government.</p>
                     <p>The Title of <hi>Honourary</hi> was firſt beſtowed on ſome worthy Phyſicians who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing or unable to come in by the right Line of Candidates. The <hi>Licentiates</hi> are ſuch as for want of ſufficient Learning, &amp;c. are
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49236:176"/>judged unfit to be received into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fellows or Candidates. Yet, becauſe they may be ſerviceable to the Publick, and do good at leaſt in ſome ſorts of Diſeaſes, they are, after due Examination and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, licenſed to practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Of this Colledge there is a Preſident, four Cenſors, and eight Elects, who are all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Members of the Society. Out of theſe one is choſen every Year to preſide, and Michaelmas is the Time of Election. But, if the Preſident chance to die before, the eldeſt Fellow has full power to execute his Place till the next Election. As for the Cenſors, 'tis their province to look to and correct thoſe Interlopers that practiſe without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Whoſe Number in London is great, and yet connived at, according to the Rule, <hi>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi> But one would wonder there ſhould be ſo many, conſidering the Hazard both they and their Patients do run by their Practice. They by the Law of England, which makes it Felony in any one preſuming to practiſe Phyſick without Authority, whoſe Patient dies under his hand.</p>
                     <p>The next Colledge of note is <hi>That of the Heralds,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Heralds Office,</hi> being upon S. Bennets Hill, near Doctors Commons. An ancient Houſe, firſt built by that Earl of Darby who married the Mother of Henry VII, and beſtowed by Queen Mary on the Kings Heralds and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevants at Arms for ever. The greateſt Part of which is rebuilt ſince the great Fire, which laid it in Aſhes. Where ſome Officers of Arms do give a conſtant Attendance, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy all Comers touching Deſcents, Pedigrees, Coats of Arms, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Within the Walls of London (in Biſhops-Gate Street) is alſo ſeated the Colledge call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> from his Founder Sir Thomas Greſham, who alſo built the Royal Exchange. After the Building whereof he gave one Moity of its Revenue to the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Commonalty of London, and their Succeſſors; the other Moiety, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Mercers in truſt, that the Mayor and Aldermen ſhould find in all Time to come four able Perſons to read within this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Divinity, Geometry, Aſtronomy, and Muſick, allowing each of them (beſides their Lodgings) 50 <abbr>

                        </abbr> a year; and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Mercers ſhould find three more able Men to read Civil Law, Phyſick, and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, with the ſame Allowance as to the former. The ſaid Lecturers to read in Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time every Day in the Week (except Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days) Aforenoon in Latine, and Afternoon the ſame in Engliſh; the Muſick Lecture to be read only in Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>This Colledge is noted beſides, for being the Meeting Place of that famous Society of Virtuoſo's called the <hi>Royal-Society;</hi> made a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration by virtue of a Charter King Charles II. granted them, bearing date the 22th of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 1663. It conſiſts of a Preſident, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and ſeveral Fellows; among which there is a Treaſurer, two Secretaries, and a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Curators or Experimentors. Their Buſineſs is, by Experiments to promote the Knowledge of Natural Things, and uſefull Arts; which they have hitherto done in a great meaſure. For, by the great Number of their Experiments and Inventions, they have mightily improved the Naval, Civil, and Military Architecture, but eſpecially the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49236:177"/>Art of Navigation. They have alſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Husbandry to that degree, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly England, but many other Countries, and even the remoteſt of our foreign Plantations, feel the ſweet effects of it. But, beſides thoſe Experiments of Fruit and Profit, they have made many curious Diſcoveries, ſuch as the learned Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls Experiments of Light. And, if they have not anſwered to the full the Expectation of ſome People in point of Uſefulneſs, they have at leaſt very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laid a ſolid Ground-work for future Ages to improve Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>Therefore King Charles gave them for their Coat of Arms a Scutcheon, with 3 Lyons of England in chief, intimating that the Society was Royal; for the Creſt an Eagle, and for the Supporter hunting Hounds, to intimate the Sagacity imployed in penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſearching after the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And His Majeſty was pleaſed, for the Credit of the Society, to liſt himſelf amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Their Meeting is upon Wedneſdays, at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. And the Office of the <hi>Preſident</hi> is to call and diſſolve the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to propoſe the Matter to be conſidered of, to put Queſtions, and call for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to admit the Members that from time to time ſhall be elected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> receives, and disburſes all Moneys. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries</hi> read all Letters and Informations both from England and foreign Parts, directed to the Society, and make ſuch Returns as the Society thinks fit. They take notice of the Orders and material Paſſages at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſegiſter all Experiments, all certain
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49236:177"/>Informations, all Concluſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and publiſh whatſoever is ordered and allowed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Laſtly, the <hi>Curators</hi> are to receive the Directions of the Society, and at another Meeting they bring all to the Teſt, the Society being Judges thereof. Whereby the World has the concurring Teſtimony of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons of undoubted Credit for the Truth of what they publiſh.</p>
                     <p>The Council conſiſts of 21 Members, eleven whereof are to be continued for the next Year, and the other ten to be choſen yearly upon the Feaſt of St. Andrew in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. After which they all dine together at a Veniſon-Feaſt.</p>
                     <p>The Manner of electing their <hi>Fellows</hi> is by Ballotting, according to the Venetian way. The Candidate is propoſed at one Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly by ſome that know him well, and the next he may be put to the Scrutiny. To carry it, he muſt have the major Number of 21 Suffrages at the leaſt. And then at that, or the next Aſſembly, he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and ſolemnly admitted by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. At his Admiſſion he ſubſcribes this Promiſe, <hi>That he will indeavour to promote the Good of the Royal Society of London, for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge;</hi> pays to the Treaſurer only 40 Shillings, and ſo long as he continues a Member 13 Shillings a Quarter. But he may at any time free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from this Obligation, by ſignifying under his hand to the Preſident that he deſires to withdraw from the Society.</p>
                     <p>Of this Society there have been all along, and are ſtill, Perſons of the higheſt Rank, and many eminent Gentlemen and Doctors, both Engliſh and Foreiners, ſober, learned, ſolid,

Who, though of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees, Religions, Countries, Profeſſions, Trades, and Fortunes; yet, laying aſide all Names of Diſtinction, have united together, amicably to promote Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

                     <p>The laſt Colledge I am to ſpeak of is another alſo within London, called <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> near Cripplegate.

                     <p>There are likewiſe in London divers <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools</hi> indowed, as <hi>St. Pauls, Merchant Taylors, Mercers Chappel,</hi> &amp;c. which in other Countries would be ſtiled Colledges. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Paul's School,</hi> a commodious and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Building at the Eaſt end of St. Paul's Ca. thedral. Founded in the Year 1512. by <hi>John Collet,</hi> Dr. of Divinity, and Dean of St. Pauls, for 153 Children to be taught there gratis. For which purpoſe he appointed a Maſter, a Sub-Maſter or Uſher, and a Chaplain, with large Stipends for ever; committing the Overſight thereof to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Wardens, and Aſſiſtants of the Mercers in London, his Father <hi>Henry Collet</hi> (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Lord Mayor of London) having been of their Company.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, for the Correction of Vagabonds, and other Perſons of a looſe Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, there are ſeveral <hi>Work-houſes.</hi> The principal of which is <hi>Bridewell</hi> near Fleet-Bridge. A ſtately Building, firſt built by King Henry VIII. for the Reception of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charles the fifth, but ſince converted to this Uſe. And, for Trying of Malefactors, there is in the Old-Baily the <hi>Seſſions-Houſe,</hi> which may go with the reſt among the Ornaments of this glorious City, as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as it is to many people that are there tried for their Lives.</p>
                     <p>Within the Precincts of Weſtminſter are alſo many Things worthy our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>I begin with <hi>Whitehall,</hi> belonging hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Cardinal Woolſey, and ſince his Time become the uſual Place of Reſidence of the Engliſh Monarchs. 'Tis ſeated betwixt the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49236:179"/>Thames on the Eaſt and a fine Park on the Weſt, amidſt the Pleaſures of the Water, and the Charms of a fine ſpacious Spot of Ground. The River of one ſide affording a great deal of Variety by the Multitude of Boats that cover it; the Park on the other ſide charming the Eye with its delicate Walks, well gravelled and as well ſhadowed, parted with a fine Canal in the middle, and this fronted with a brazen Statue, which for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Workmanſhip is admired by Artiſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Whitehall</hi> it ſelf, I confeſs its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance is not great, but it is very convenient, and more glorious within than without. And yet the Chamber at the front of it, called the <hi>Banquetting-Houſe,</hi> is ſuch a Piece of Building as for Spaciouſneſs, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Painting, and exact Proportion, is not to be parallelled by any King in Europe; the Cieling whereof was all painted by the hand of the famous Sir <hi>Peter Paul Rubens.</hi> Here is alſo, beſides the Proteſtant Chappel, a neat one built by the late King James for his Uſe, which by the Grace of God ly's now dormant. And in one of the Courts ſtands his Brazen Statue, which has had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luck than that of Newcaſtle upon Tine.</p>
                     <p>On the North-Weſt ſide of the Park is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Royal Pallace, called <hi>St. James,</hi> which gives name to the Park. In the Strand is another Pallace, called <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> where the Queen Dowager reſides, and keeps her Dourt. This was built by Edward, Duke of Somerſet, Uncle to King Edward the fixth.</p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:49236:179"/>
                     <p>But the Glory of Weſtminſter is the <hi>Abbey-Church</hi> there, founded before the Norman Conqueſt by King Edward the Confeſſour, and moſt richly indowed; afterwards rebuilt from the Ground by King Henry III. This huge Fabrick ſtands on that piece of Ground which formerly was called <hi>Thorney-Iſland;</hi> then ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Water, and where of old ſtood a Temple dedicated to Apollo. In this Church is uſually performed the Coronation of our Kings, with that Pomp and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence as becomes ſuch potent Monarchs. On the Eaſt end of it is <hi>Henry the Sevenths Chappel,</hi> built by that King with admirable artificial Work both within and without. And here are the Tombs and Monuments of ſeveral of our Kings and Queens, among which that of maſſy Braſs is ſo curiouſly wrought, that it is ſcarcely to be parallelled.</p>
                     <p>The Abbey was converted into a Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Church by Queen Elizabeth, who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein a Dean, and 12 Prebendaries; beſides about 30 petty Canons and others, belonging to the Quire. The Dean is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Cuſtody of the <hi>Regalia</hi> at the Coronation, and honoured with a Place of neceſſary Service at all Coronations.</p>
                     <p>Adjoyning to this Church is a famous <hi>School</hi> and <hi>Colledge</hi> called <hi>Weſtminſter School,</hi> a Seminary for the Univerſities. The Colledge conſiſts of 40 Scholars, commonly called <hi>Kings Scholars;</hi> who, being choſen out of the School, and put into the Colledge, are there maintained. And, as they are fitted for the Univerſity, they are yearly elected away, and placed with good Allowances in Chriſt-Church Colledge in Oxford, and Trinity College in Cambridge.</p>

                     <p>Here is alſo in the Cloyſters a fair publick <hi>Library,</hi> free for all Strangers to ſtudy both Morning and Afternoon always in Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
                     <p>Next this Church ſtood the <hi>Royal Pallace</hi> of the Kings of England, a great Part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was burnt down in the Time of Henry VIII. What remained has ſtill been imploy'd for the Uſe of the Lords and Commons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament, and for the chief Courts of Judicature. The great Hall where theſe are kept, commonly called <hi>Weſiminſter-Hell,</hi> is 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth, for its Dimenſions not to be equalled by any Hall in Chriſtendom. And were it ſet out according to its Greatneſs and the Dignity of the Courts that are kept there, it might paſs for one of the moſt remarkable Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Europe.

Thoſe of <hi>Sohoe,</hi> which alone might make a good large City, and many more too numerous to inſiſt upon; All theſe, together with ſo many fine <hi>Piazza's</hi> or <hi>Squares</hi> I have already mentioned, are enough (if
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49236:180"/>duly conſidered) to raiſe the Admiration of all Strangers.</p>
                     <p>But, for a publick Building of a late Erection, 'tis worth our while to ſtep out of the Way, and take a View of <hi>Chelſey-H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A ſtately Pile, which in ſome reſpects outdo's, in others is out done by the famous <hi>Hotel des Invalides</hi> at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</p>
                     <p>As for the Government of London and Weſtminſter, the City of London, with the Liberties thereof, is governed in chief as to Civil Affairs, by a <hi>MAYOR,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Lord</hi> prefixt, given to no Mayor in England but that of London, and of late to the Mayor of York. In the Time of the Romans, he was called <hi>Prefect of London;</hi> in the Saxons time, <hi>Port-greeve,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Provoſt of London;</hi> and, after the Coming in of the Normans, <hi>Bayliff.</hi> 'Twas King Richard I, who in the Year 1189 (being the firſt of his Reign) changed the Name of Bayliff into that of <hi>Mayor,</hi> a French Word originally; which has continued ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>This great and mighty Magiſtrate is yearly choſen by the Citizens, upon Michaelmas Day, the 29th of September. The Body out of which he is choſen are the 26 <hi>Aldermen,</hi> all Perſons of great Wealth and Wiſdom, at leaſt ought ſo to be. Thoſe that chuſe him are firſt the <hi>Livory-men,</hi> or Members of the ſeveral Companies of Tradeſmen within the City,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:49236:181"/>and at laſt the Aldermen; which is done in this manner. Firſt, the Livery-Men do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put up four Candidates, out of which they chuſe two by the Plurality of Voices; and, out of theſe two, the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſelect whom they think fit. And, though they be free in their Choice, yet commonly they have a regard for the Senior Alderman that has not been Lord Mayor, and give him the Precedence.</p>
                     <p>The Mayor Elect being Proclaimed, is ſworn firſt at Guildhall, and afterwards at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. There he ſwears to maintain the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the People; and here, to be True to the King.</p>
                     <p>The Inſtallation-Day is the 29th of October, a Month after the Election. The Solemnity of which Day upon his Account is ſo great, that no Magiſtrate in Europe appears with ſo much ſtate and grandure as the Mayor of London upon his Inſtallation. Firſt, he go's by water to Weſtminſter in his Barge of ſtate, accompanied with the Aldermen in all their Formalities, with their Scarlet Robes and Chains of gold hanging before their Breaſts. The Twelve Companies alſo, in their ſeveral Barges, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his way he is ſaluted from the Shore with the noiſe of great Guns; and, as he paſſes by Whitehall, the King from thence viewing the Solemnity gives him and his Brethren a Mark of his Reſpect. At laſt being landed at Weſtminſter Bridge, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Companies march in order to their Hall, and after them the Mayor and Aldermen, with the Sword and Mace before them, the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer with his Cap of Maintenance on his
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49236:181"/>head. At their Entrance into the Hall, the Hall is Intertained with the harmonious Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of a Set of Hoboys, marching in order before them, and playing all the Way. Firſt they walk round the Hall, where they pay their reſpects to each Court of Judicature; and from the Hall they proceed to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-Chamber, where the New Lord Mayor is Sworn by the Barons. This done, they walk again in Proceſſion round the Hall, to invite the ſeveral Judges of each Court to Dinner at Guildhall. And, after this, the whole Proceſſion returns in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by Water to Black-Friars. From whence the Lord Mayor and Aldermen make their Cavalcade to Guildhall, all mounted upon Horſes richly Capariſoned; the Livery-Men marching before in good order. And now the <hi>Artillery men</hi> make their beſt appearance, with their Buff-coats and Head-pieces. But the moſt diverting Sight is that of the <hi>Pageants,</hi> here and there in motion to divert the Spectators. At laſt a moſt ſplendid Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to which, beſides the Judges, many of the great Lords and Ladies, the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, the forein Embaſſadors, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the King and Queen are invited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>Such is the Magnificence of the Lord Mayor of London, though always a Citizen and Tradeſman, being a Member of one of the 12 Companies. Who, for his great Dignity, is uſually Knighted by the King, before the Year of his Mayoralty be expired; unleſs he had received that Honour before, whilſt he was an Alderman, as of late has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His Authority reaches, not only all over this great City and part of the Suburbs, (except ſome particular Places) but alſo on the Thames as far as the Mouth of it, and Weſtward as far as Stanes-Bridge.</p>
                     <p>And ſo great is his Power, that he may cauſe any Perſon inhabiting within London, or the Liberties thereof, to be Summoned to appear before him, upon the Complaint of any Citizen; and, for Non-appearance, may grant his Warrant to bring ſuch Perſon before him. For he has Power to determine Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between Party and Party.</p>
                     <p>His Attendance, whilſt he is a Mayor, is very conſiderable. For, beſides his proper Servants, firſt he has four principal Officers that wait on him as Lord Mayor, who are reputed Eſquires by their Places. And thoſe are the <hi>Sword-bearer,</hi> the <hi>Common Hunt,</hi> the <hi>Common Crier,</hi> and the <hi>Water-Bayliff;</hi> whoſe Places are very advantageous, and purchaſed (when vacant) at a great rate from the Lord Mayor for the time being. Beſides them, there is the <hi>Coroner,</hi> 3 <hi>Sergeants Carvers,</hi> 3 <hi>Sergeants of the Chamber,</hi> 1 <hi>Sergeant of the Channel,</hi> 4 <hi>Yeomen of the Waterſide,</hi> 1 <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Water-Bayliff,</hi> 2 <hi>Yeomen of the Chamber,</hi> 3 <hi>Meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Weighers,</hi> 2 <hi>Yeomen of the Wood-Wharf,</hi> and ſeveral others. Moſt of which have Servants allowed them, with Livories. Among which the <hi>Sword-bearer</hi> has a 1000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his Table in the Lord Mayor's Houſe.</p>
                     <p>When he appears abroad on horſeback (which is his uſual Appearance) 'tis with rich Capariſon, and always in long Robes, ſometimes of fine Scarlet-Cloth richly furred, ſometimes Purple, and ſometimes Puke, with
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49236:182"/>a black Velvet Hood over his Robes, and a great Chain of Gold (with a rich Jewel to it) hanging from his Neck downwards. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſeveral Officers walking before, and on both ſides of him.</p>
                     <p>He keeps an open Table all the Year to all Comers of any quality; and ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that it is always fit to receive the greateſt Subject of England, or of any other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate. He has a Priviledge to hunt, not only in Middleſex, but alſo in Eſſex and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, and for this purpoſe has a Kennel of Hounds always maintained. On the King's Coronation-Day he claims to be the chief Butler, and bears the King's Cup among the higheſt Nobles of the Kingdom which ſerve on that Day in other Offices. And, upon the King's Death, he is ſaid to be the prime Perſon of England. Therefore, when King James I, was invited to come and take the Crown of England, <hi>Robert Lee,</hi> then May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of London, ſubſcribed in the firſt place, before all the Officers of the Crown, and all the Nobility.</p>
                     <p>One Thing is obſervable, which hapned not long ſince. I mean four Mayors the City had in little more than half a Year; viz. <hi>Sir John Shorter, Sir John Eyles, Sir John Chapman,</hi> and <hi>Sir Thomas Pilkington.</hi> For, upon the Death of the firſt in September 1688, <hi>Sir John Eyles</hi> was made Lord Mayor; and in October fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Charter being reſtored, <hi>Sir John Chapman</hi> was choſen Lord Mayor. Who dying in March following, <hi>Sir Thomas Pilkington</hi> was choſen in his room. In whoſe Perſon the Chance is turned almoſt quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For, if he do's outlive the Time appointed for his Mayoralty by his late
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49236:183"/>Re-election, inſtead of being Mayor but one Year, according to the uſual Courſe, his Mayoralty will reach near two Years and a half.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Lord Mayor there are

Now the Aldermen who have been Lord Mayors, and the three eldeſt Aldermen that have not yet arrived to that honourable eſtate, are by the City-Charter Juſtices of Peace of the City. Upon the Death of an Alderman, the Lord Mayor iſſues out his Precept to the Ward whereof he was Alderman, to chuſe two ſubſtantial Men of the City, and return their Names to the Court of Aldermen. Which being done, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen ſelect one of the two, ſuch as they judge fitteſt for that Station.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Recorder</hi> is uſually a grave and learned Lawyer, well verſed in the Laws and Cuſtoms of the City, and in that Capacity is an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to the Lord Mayor.

                     <p>Each Company (or Myſtery) has a Maſter yearly choſen from among themſelves; and other ſubordinate Governours, called War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Aſſiſtants. Such is the Harmony of this Government, that theſe Companies do exactly correſpond to the general Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City by a Lord Mayor and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, who are ſelected out of theſe ſeveral Companies. For he that is choſen Lord Mayor muſt be free of one of theſe 12 Companies; and, if he be of any other Company, he preſently removes to one of theſe. Which have got ſo great Credit and Reputation in the World, that ſeveral Kings have honoured ſome of them by taking their Freedom thereof. The preſent King was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed to accept of the Freedom of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49236:184"/>Company of Grocers; preſented to Him in a golden Box in the Name of the City by Mr. <hi>Box;</hi> upon which he was Knighted by His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, ſuch are the Priviledges of the Citizens of London, that they are Toll-free throughout England. And the Lord Mayor uſually, at the Requeſt of any Citizen that trades in remote Parts, grants him his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Certificate.</p>
                     <p>They have alſo the Priviledge to keep out all Artificers and Handicraftſmen not free of the City. So that if a Freeman of London do imploy any ſuch to work within the City or Liberties, he is liable to the Forfeiture of 5 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Day, and an Action lies againſt him for the ſame. An Alien indeed may be imploy'd ſix Weeks, but no longer. And how ſevere ſoever this may ſeem to Foreiners, yet it is grounded upon Equity. For were it not for that Priviledge, here would be ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Foreiners, that it would prove (as it has by Experience) the utter undoing of a great Number of poor Citizens and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe Livelyhood depends upon their Handicrafts.</p>
                     <p>Another great Priviledge they have, is their ſending no leſs than four Members to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which is twice the Number of other Cities and Borough-Towns in England. And it is obſervable, that their Members do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear in their Scarlet-Robes the firſt Day the Parliament ſits, when all other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (except the Speaker of the Houſe) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their uſual Habit.</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49236:185"/>
                     <p>Thus the Lord Mayor of London, under the gracious Influences of the Engliſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, makes a Figure more like a Prince than a Subject. And the Citizens of London, though under the ſame general Government as all the reſt of the Kings Subjects, yet live within themſelves, bleſt with ſo many Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that I can compare them no better than to the old Citizens of Rome under the beſt of their Emperours.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the main Thing which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Trade here to that degree as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Place ſo rich and flouriſhing, is the great Charters, Priviledges, and Immunities it is inveſted with, by the Munificence of ſeveral of the former Kings. Whereby the Londoners are Impowered to chuſe their own Magiſtrates, to do themſelves Juſtice, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Peace, and purſue all the good and advantagious Ends of Trade, with the better Succeſs and greater Security. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which they keep within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many Courts and Councils, where they make Laws for the better Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeveral Ranks and Orders of Men among them. And, though theſe grand Priviledges were judged to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by the Court of Kings Bench upon the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought in at the latter end of Charles II his Reign, and a new Charter granted the City, but with ſeveral Reſtrictions of great moment; yet that Judgement was Reverſed upon their late Application to the Parliament, and their ancient Charter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. So that Things run now, as they did before that Judgment, in their proper Channel.</p>

                     <p>For Military Affairs, the City of <hi>London</hi> is a Lieutenancy of it ſelf. So that the Power of a Lord Lieutenant is in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and other principal Members of the City, for the Time being. Who, by a peculiar Commiſſion from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, are authorized to act as his Lieutenants in London, for the ordering the City-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, with the ſame Power that the Lord Lieutenants have in their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>Now the City-Militia conſiſts of 6 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, making about 90000 men; beſides the Hamlets of the Tower 2 Regiments, and the Regiment of Southwark. To which if we add the Militia of Weſtminſter, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 2 Regiments, called Holborn and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, each of 2000 men, we find in all eleven Regiments. But, in caſe of Neceſſity the Auxiliaries are raiſed, conſiſting of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, which make up ſix Regiments more; every Freeman that has two Apprentices find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>To ſupply the City Train-Bands and Auxiliary men with Commanders, there is a Nurſery of Souldiers, called the <hi>Artillery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> of above 60 Years ſtanding. This Company conſiſts of 600 choice men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief by the King, and under his Majeſty by a Leader. Who exerciſes this Company every Tueſday fortnight in the Artillery-Ground, a ſpacious Place near Moorfields, incloſed for that purpoſe with a fair Brick-Wall. And the other Tueſday the Exerciſe is performed by the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Company, who are there trained up to command, moſt of them being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Train-Bands. They have a
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49236:186"/>Court-Marſhal, conſiſting of a Preſident, Vice-Preſident, Colonel, and 24 Members of the Company. On the ſecond Tueſday in February is their general Rendezvous every Year, when they chuſe their Officers. Which, beſides the Leader, are two Lieutenants, 2 Enſigns, 2 Sergeants, a Provoſt Marſhal, 3 Gentlemen of Arms, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Church-Government is by the Biſhop of London. The Pariſhes whereof, for the moſt part provided with able and eminent Divines under the Title of Rector or Vicar, are under his Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>And, for maintaining theſe Divines, with their Families, there is in moſt Pariſhes a Parſonage, or Vicarage-Houſe, with a yearly Allowance, beſides the Perquiſites ariſing from Chriſtenings, Marriages, and Burials. Which Allowance, ſince the Reformation, falls much ſhort of what it was in the time of Popery; when, beſides the Tythes of the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Gains, the Mortuaries, Obits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Prieſt (tho' in a ſtate of Celibacy) had 3 ſhillings and 5 pence in the pound of the yearly Rent of all the Houſes and Shops in his Pariſh. Which afterwards was brought to 2 ſhillings, 9 pence in the pound, by an Act of Parliament under the Reign of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VIII, and that confirmed by a ſubſequent Act. But, ſince the Reformation, this being lookt upon as too large an Allowance, it has been ſo curtailed, that 'twill be hard to bring back that golden Age. 'Tis true under the Reign of Charles II. a Regulation was made by Act of Parliament, but it concerned only thoſe Pariſhes, whoſe Churches had been demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the dreadfull Fire. And, according
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49236:186"/>to the ſeveral Extents of Pariſhes, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof, by virtue of that Act, have a certain yearly Allowance, none under 100 Pounds, and none above 200; but moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one and two hundred Pounds. The ſame to be raiſed, in lieu of Tythe, within the ſaid reſpective Pariſhes, by rating the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Shops therein proportionably to their reſpective Rents. As to thoſe Pariſhes all over the City and Suburbs where there is, beſides the Parſon, a Lecturer, he has his maintenance no otherwiſe than by a voluntary Contribution from the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>As for the City of Weſtminſter, the Dean and Chapter are inveſted with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Juriſdiction, both Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical; not only within the City of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, but alſo in other Places of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as the Precincts of S. Martin le Grand within the Walls of London, and ſome Towns in Eſſex. The Dean in particular has a Commiſſion of Peace within the City and Liberties of Weſtminſter.</p>
                     <p>The principal Officer in it, called the High Steward of Weſtminſter, is uſually one of the prime Nobility. Under whom there is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Steward, then the Bayliff, and the two high Burgeſſes, theſe choſen every Year.</p>
                     <p>Within the Precincts of Weſtminſter, but chiefly near the Court, the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try take up for the moſt part their Quarters. But the proper Station of the Lawyers is in their Inns, between the City and the Court; and that of Merchants and Seamen, in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eaſt-end of the City.</p>

                     <p>Thus you have a ſhort Deſcription of the famous City of London, the Metropolis of England, the Seat of the Britiſh Empire, the Epitome and Glory of this Kingdom. A City which for Greatneſs, Beauty, Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, Plenty of Proviſions, Commerce, Riches, and good Government, is inferiour to none beyond Sea. 'Tis a Magazine of all ſorts of Commodities, neceſſary or expedient for the Uſe or Pleaſure of Mankind. The great Rendez-vous of the Nobility, Gentry, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, Divines, Lawyers, Phyſicians, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Seamen, of the beſt Artificers, the moſt refined Wits, and the greateſt Beauties of the Land.</p>
                     <p>For a conſtant Supply of Proviſions, here are abundance of <hi>Markets,</hi> the beſt furniſhed of any in Chriſtendom; but eſpecially <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market,</hi> near the Royal Exchange in the City, the greateſt Fleſh-Market about the City, and a great Magazine of Corn. So that there is ſcarce a great City in Europe, where poor People, or ſuch as love a frugal Life, may live cheaper, or the ſplendid Liver, gallanter.</p>
                     <p>To get a Livelyhood, and raiſe himſelf in the World, no Place like this; by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick or Liberal Arts, by Merchandizing, Offices, Preferments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Conveniencies and Delight, here all is at hand; and ſcarce any Thing wanting, that Money can purchaſe. In point of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, here learned and unlearned, high and low, rich and poor, good and bad, may fit themſelves any where.</p>
                     <p>And this I muſt needs ſay to the Praiſe of <hi>London,</hi> that, there is not a Place in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope of ſuch a vaſt Confluence of all ſorts of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49236:187"/>People, where Murders and Outrages, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in great and populous Cities beyond Sea, are ſo ſeldom heard of. Which argues a great deal of Wiſdom in the Magiſtrate, that ſo great a Body ſhould be kept in ſo good Order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William the Conquerour,</hi> to prevent Diſorders and Miſchiefs in the Night, commanded that in every Town and Village a Bell (called <hi>Curfew-Bell,</hi> a Corrupt Word from the French <hi>Couvre-feu</hi>) ſhould be rung every Night at 8 of the Clock, and that all people ſhould then put out their Fire and Candle. This continued in his Reign, and that of his next Succeſſor <hi>William Rufus.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> I. revoked that Order; and <hi>Henry</hi> III. Anno 1253. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Watches to be kept in Cities and Boroughs, for the Preſervation of Peace and Quietneſs among his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Therefore there are in the reſpective Streets of London to this day convenient Stations for the Watchmen; who are to examine all Perſons walking in unſeaſonable Hours, and to ſecure till next Day ſuch as are either ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious or riotous. And then they bring them before a Juſtice of Peace, who deals with them according to the Merit of the Cauſe. Thus Murders, Robberies, Felonies, Fires, and other Evils, are oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; which could not be avoided in ſo great and populous a Place, where a great many wicked People ly lurking for Miſchief. This Duty of Watching is commonly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men hired for that purpoſe, and paid for't by the Citizens, under the Command of a Conſtable, aſſiſted by the Eeadle of the Pariſh. In caſe of a publick Riot, the King uſually ſends a Party of his Gards to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49236:188"/>it; and, if occaſion requires, part of the Militia is raiſed.</p>
                     <p>But, to draw to a Concluſion, if we caſt our Eyes upon the vaſt Traffick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, whereby this Place is become ſo flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, it will every where afford matter of Admiration. The ſame does plainly appear by the Cuſtoms yearly paid for all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe Imported and Exported, by the great Wealth of many Citizens, by the infinite Number of Shops both in the City and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs for the Retailing Trade, and laſtly by the incredible Abundance of Apprentices which are here brought up to all manner of Trades.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtoms for this City alone (tho' ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate, in compariſon of moſt other Places in Europe) did lately amount to near 400000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year. The Wealth of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſo vaſt, that ſome of 'em, for great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in Mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excel ſome Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea; and live accordingly in great ſtate and plenty, few ſo penuriouſly as moſt of the Dutch Merchants do. The Number of Shops both in the City and Suburbs ſo great, and indeed ſo far beyond that of any forei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> City, that it is to Strangers a juſt Matter of Amazement. Proportionable to which is That of the Apprentices, reckoned to be at leaſt forty thouſand.</p>
                     <p>Now this great Trade of the Londoners runs into three ſeveral Streams, 1. among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 2 in the Country, and 3 beyond Sea, of which in my ſecond Part.</p>
                     <p>Only I ſhall obſerve here, that the vaſt Trade of this Place has chiefly occaſioned that great Appearance in it of <hi>Pictures in the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49236:188"/>Air,</hi> a Thing taken particular notice of at the firſt view by Strangers. I mean the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Signs which hang before the Houſes; many of them very rich and coſtly, and all together yielding a fine Proſpect.</p>
                     <p>But, on the other ſide, its frequent <hi>Dirt</hi> in Winter, and <hi>Duſt</hi> in Summer, are two ſuch Nuſances as take off very much from the Glory of it. And yet both of them might with eaſe be Remedied, and will (I hope) in time. For, in point of Cleanneſs, few Towns are better Seated than London is, ſtanding upon an eaſy Aſcent from the River. And the Allowance for it from each Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper is ſo conſiderable, that one would think it enough to keep it cleaner than it is. But the Truth is, there's a ſort of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> that can extract Gold out of Dirt. And I conjecture the leſs Care has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to take off that Reproach from ſo noble a City, becauſe of the two great Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences it has to go free from the Dirt from one End of it to the other, that is, by Land in Coaches, and by Water in Boats. Beſides that the principal Streets, and moſt of the New Buildings, are paved a good conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Breadth on each ſide with ſmooth hewn Stone, for the benefit of Foot-Paſſengers. Which is a great Commodiouſneſs, as well as an Ornament.</p>
                     <p>I conclude, as to <hi>Loudon,</hi> with three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Conveniencies it has, not elſewhere to be found; Viz. the <hi>New Lights,</hi> the <hi>Peny-Poſt,</hi> and the <hi>Inſurance-Office for Houſes in caſe of</hi> Fire.</p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:49236:189"/>
                     <p>The <hi>New Lights</hi> is ſo ingenious and uſefull an Invention, that Mr. <hi>Edmund Heming</hi> the Inventor deſerves an immortal Praiſe for it. He brought it to light about 6 Years ago, with a Patent from King Charles II, for the Injoyment of the Profits thereof. And ſuch is the Reflexion of theſe Lights, tho' at a good diſtance from each other, that few of them ſerve to light a whole Street in the Night, better than ten times the Number of Glaſs Lanthorns. For, by the regular Poſition of one of them before the Front of every tenth Houſe on each ſide of a broad Street, there is ſuch a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that they all ſeem to be but one great ſolar Light.</p>
                     <p>And ſo cheap is this Conveniency, that for five Shillings down and five Shillings a Year for five Years, to be paid at two Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Payments, the Inventor obliges himſelf to light the Front of ones Houſe from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas to Lady Day every Night from ſix to twelve, beginning the third Night after every Full-Moon, and ending the ſixth Night after every New Moon, which is in all 120 Nights.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peny-Post</hi> is ſuch a Contrivance, that for one Peny a Letter, or Parcel not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one pound Weight, or ten pounds in value, is preſently conveyed from all Parts of the Town and Suburbs to the remoteſt Places thereof. And it has been ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, ſince the firſt ſettling of it, as to reath ten miles about London. He that ſends pays the Peny; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd, when the Letter or Parcel goes beyond the Bounds of the Weekly Bills of Mortality, the Receiver pays another Peny.</p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:49236:189"/>
                     <p>To carry on this uſefull Deſign, firſt there are about the Town four or five hundred Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to take in Letters and Parcels. And, to convey them according to their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there are about 100 meſſengers imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Morning to Night, to call every Hour at the ſaid Houſes, and take what Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Parcels they find there. Who carry the ſame to their reſpective Offices, from whence the Letters and Parcels are diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away according to their Directions. The Offices are ſix in Number; Viz.

And for this Contrivance the Publick is indebted to that ingenious Citizen of London, Mr. <hi>William Dockwrea,</hi> who ſettled it ſome Years ſince, not without much trouble and coſt. But the late King, when Duke of York, ſued him for the lame, as his Right, and carried it from the Inventor. So that the Benefit of it is now inherent in the Crown.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inſurance Office for Houſes in caſe of Fire</hi> is alſo an Invention worth our taking notice. To Inſure, for example, 100 <abbr>

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49236:190"/>the Rates are 6 Shillings for one Year, 12 for two Years, 18 for three Years; and double for a Timber-houſe. But, if any Inſure for four Years, there is a Diſcount allowed for paying down the Mony, ſo that he pays but three Years and a Quarter; and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably five for ſeven, ſeven for eleven Years Inſurance. And, as often as the Houſe is Burnt, or Demoliſhed by reaſon of Fire, within the Term Inſured, the Mony Inſured on the Houſe is to be paid; but, if only Damaged, then to be Repaired at the Charge of the Office. For the ſecurity of which Payment, the Office has a Fund to the Value of 60000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> in Ground-Rents of Inheritance (which is above 2600 <hi>

                     <p>This Ingenious and Uſefull Invention was firſt put into practice about 8 Years ſince, and has deſervedly met with good Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſomuch that there are now above 7300 Houſes Inſured.

                        <p>But, as now in <hi>Leyden</hi> and many other forein Univerſities, ſo anciently in Oxford the Students lived in Citizens Houſes, having only Meeting Places to hear Lectures and Diſputations, and that without any diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Habit. After that, there were divers Houſes (now called Halls) for Students only to live together in Society, as now the Inns of Court and of Chancery at London.

                           </gap>arge Revenues, great Salaries for publick Profeſſors, and Allowances for poor Scholars, &amp;c. would require another Volume. But this I muſt ſay of the <hi>Bodlean Library,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49236:193"/>lightſom Fabrick, that for Number of choice Books, rare Manuſcripts, diverſity of Languages, liberty of ſtudying, and facility of finding any Book, it ſcarce falls ſhort of the famous Vatican. The New <hi>Theatre,</hi> built for Scholaſtick Exerciſes by Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> the late moſt Reverend Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, is ſo curious a Piece of Architecture, that it were a Treſpaſs not to take notice of it. And the publick <hi>Phyſick Garden,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſtately Stone-Walls, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Variety of choice Plants, is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful a Place, that I could not do leſs than mention it.</p>
                        <p>But the lately erected <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> finiſhed in the Year 1683, deſerves a brief Account. 'Tis a large and ſtately Pile of ſquared Stone, built at the Charge of the Univerſity, and deſigned not only to advance the Studies of true and real Philoſophy, but alſo to conduce to the Uſes of Life, and the Improvement of Phyſick. This Building borders upon the Weſt-end of the Theater, having a ſtately Portal on that ſide, ſuſtained by Pillars of the Corinthian Order. But the Front of it is to the Street Northward. It conſiſts of ten Rooms, whereof the three principal and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt are publick, being in length about 56 foot, and in breadth 25. The uppermoſt is properly the <hi>Muſaeum Aſhmoleanum,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Elias Aſhmole</hi> Eſquire, who inriched it with a noble Collection of Curioſities. To which have been added ſince ſeveral Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks, and other Aegyptian Antiquities by Dr. <hi>Robert Huntington;</hi> an intire Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by Mr. <hi>Aaron Goodyear;</hi> a large Cabinet of Natural Rarities, by <hi>Martin Liſter,</hi> Dr. of Phyſick; beſides ſeveral Roman Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:49236:193"/>as Altars, Medals, Lamps, &amp;c. found here in England. So that in a few Years this is like to be one of the moſt famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories in Europe. The middle Room is the School of Natural Hiſtory, where the Profeſſor of Chymiſtry reads 3 times a Week, on Mundays, Wedneſdays, and Fridays, during the time of the Chymical Courſe, which continues a whole Month. His Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to explain the natures, qualities, and virtues, &amp;c. of all natural Bodies, relating to and made uſe of in Chymical Preparations. The lower Room is the Laboratory, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all ſorts of Furnaces, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, in order to Chymical Practice. Near unto which is the Store-Room for Chymical Preparations, and another fitted for a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Library.</p>
                        <p>Now every Colledge has within its own Walls Lectures and Diſputations in all Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arts; and ſome of them publick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures for all Comers, with large Salaries for the Readers. Inſomuch that they ſeem to be ſo many Univerſities.</p>
                        <p>The whole Number of Students in Oxford, that live upon the Revenues of the Colledges, is about One thouſand; and of other Students, about twice as many. Beſides Stewards, Manciples, Butlers, Cooks, Porters, Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>He that intends to take any Degree is to take his Diet and Lodging, and have a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor conſtantly, in ſome Colledge or Hall; where he muſt be ſubject to all Statutes, and to the Head of the Houſe. He muſt be likewiſe ſubject to the chief Magiſtrate of the Univerſity, and the publick Statutes thereof. He is conſtantly to wear a black Cap and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49236:194"/>Gown, only the Sons of Noblemen are herein indulged. By Night all Scholars are to be ſhut up in their ſeveral Houſes. And, before they can attain to any Degree, they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all Exerciſes.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Degrees</hi> taken in the Univerſity are in Arts properly but two, viz. of <hi>Batchelour</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi> To take the Degree of <hi>Batchelor</hi> is required 4 Years, and 3 Years more for to be <hi>Maſter of Arts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the three Profeſſions of Divinity, Law, and Phyſick, there is a higher Degree, that of <hi>Doctor,</hi> which requires a great deal more time. For, to attain unto it, a Maſter of Arts muſt be firſt capable of being a <hi>Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> in any of thoſe Profeſſions; which in Divinity requires 7 Years more, in Law or Phyſick moſt commonly but 3. And, after that, before the Degree of <hi>Doctor</hi> can be had, 4 Years more is requiſite.</p>
                        <p>The Exerciſes required for taking theſe Degrees are many, and difficult enough; yet not ſuch but that they may be performed in leſs time by any Man of good Abilities. But ſo much Time is required, firſt becauſe Judgement and Diſcretion comes with Time and Years; and perhaps, that thoſe of ſlower Parts might by Time and Induſtry make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves capable of that Honour, as well as thoſe of quicker Abilities.</p>
                        <p>The Time of compleating the Degree of <hi>Batchelor of Arts</hi> is in Lent, at which time there commonly proceed about 200 Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. And that of compleating the Degree of <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> or of <hi>Doctor</hi> in any of the three Profeſſions, is always the Munday after the ſixth of July, when there proceed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> or <hi>Doctors</hi> yearly about 150. Then is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49236:194"/>the <hi>Act,</hi> that is the Time, not only for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exerciſes, but alſo for Feaſtings and Comedies, unleſs ſome extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do hinder it. Which draw's a mighty Concourſe of Strangers from all Parts to their Friends and Relations then compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Degrees. Whereby, and by the ſet Fees, it uſually coſts a Doctor about 100 <abbr>
                              <hi>l.</hi>
                           </abbr> ſterling, and a Maſter of Arts 20 or 30 pounds.</p>
                        <p>But, beſides theſe famous Societies in the Colledges and Halls of this Univerſity, there is another lately eſtabliſhed, by the Name of the <hi>Philoſophical Society,</hi> for the Improvement of real and experimental Philoſophy. This Society (being much of the ſame nature as the Royal Society at London, with whom they have ſettled a Correſpondency) meets every Tueſday in the Afternoon, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and favour of the Government, in the Natural Hiſtory-School.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, as this City conſiſts of two ſorts of Inhabitants, Students and Citizens, living one among another, ſo they are wholly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for Government and Manners.</p>
                        <p>The chief Magiſtrate of the Univerſity is called the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who is uſually One of the prime Nobility, and neareſt in favour with the King; Elected by the Students themſelves in Convocation, to continue <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante Vita.</hi> Whoſe Office is to take care of the Government of the whole Univerſity, to maintain the Liberties and Priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to call Aſſemblies to hear and determine Controverſies, to call Courts, puniſh Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, &amp;c.</p>
                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:49236:195"/>
                        <p>The next is the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> who is yearly nominated by the Chancellor, and is commonly the Head of ſome Colledge. His Duty is, in the Chancellor's abſence, to do whatever almoſt the Chancellour might do if he were preſent. He keeps Judicial Courts, wholly ruled by the Civil Law, which all Members of the Univerſity are ſubject to. And, by Charter of Henry IV, it is left to his Choice, whether any Member in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity there inhabiting, accuſed for Felony or High Treaſon, ſhall be tried by the Laws of the Land, or by the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Univerſity. Though now, where Life or Limb is concerned, the Criminal is left to be tried by the Laws of the Land. But in all Suits for Debts, Accounts, Contracts, Injuries, &amp;c. betwixt the Students, he is the proper Judge; and has Power to determine ſuch Cauſes, to Impriſon, to give corporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to excommunicate, to ſuſpend, and to baniſh.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the Vice-Chancellor's Buſineſs to ſee, that Sermons, Lectures, Diſputations, and other Exerciſes, be performed; that lewd people, Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be expelled the Univerſity, and the Converſe with Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; that the Proctors, and other Officers of the Univerſity, duly perform their Duty; that Courts be duly called, and Law-Suits determined without delay. In a word, that whatever is for the Honour and Benefit of the Univerſity, or may conduce to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of good Literature, may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obtained.</p>
                        <p>Next to the Vice-Chancellor are the two <hi>Proctors,</hi> yearly choſen by turns out of the ſeveral Colledges. Theſe are to aſſiſt in the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49236:195"/>Government of the Univerſity; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the buſineſs of Scholaſtick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and taking Degrees, in ſearching after and puniſhing all Violaters of Statutes or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Univerſity, all Night-Walkers, &amp;c. They have alſo the Overſight of Weights and Meaſures, that Students may not be wronged.</p>
                        <p>Next in order is the <hi>Publick Orator.</hi> Whoſe Charge is to write Letters, according to the Orders of the Convocation or Congregation; and, at the Reception of any Prince or great Perſon that comes to ſee the Univerſity, to make proper Harangues, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Then there is the <hi>Cuſtos Archivorum,</hi> or Keeper of Records. Whoſe Duty is to collect and keep the Charters, Priviledges, and Records that concern the Univerſity; to be always ready to produce them before the chief Officers; and to plead the Rights and Priviledges of the Univerſity.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, there is a <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity; whoſe Office is to regiſter all Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Convocations, Congregations, Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the foreſaid Officers, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain publick Servants, the chief whereof are the ſix <hi>Beadles,</hi> and the <hi>Verger.</hi> Three of the firſt are called <hi>Squire Beadles,</hi> who carry large Maces of Silver gilt; and the other three, <hi>Yeomen Beadles,</hi> whoſe Maces are of Silver but ungilt. Their Office is always to wait on the Vice-Chancellor in publick, doing what belongs to his Place; and, at his Command, to ſeize any Delinquent, and carry him to Priſon; to ſummon, and publiſh the Calling of Courts or Convocations, to conduct Preachers to Church, and Lecturers to School,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49236:196"/>&amp;c. But, upon Solemnities, the <hi>Verger</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with a Silver Rod in his hand; and, walking with the other ſix before the Vice-Chancellor, is to obſerve his Commands, and to wait on Grand Compounders, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I have already mentioned ſeveral great Priviledges, granted by former Kings to this Univerſity. That of ſending two Burgeſſes to Parliament they hold from King James I. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that no Victuals be taken by the King's Purveyors within 5 miles of Oxford, unleſs the King himſelf comes thither, is of a much more ancient Date.</p>
                        <p>But one of the moſt conſiderable is That granted by Charter of King Edward III, whereby the Mayor of Oxford is to obey the Orders of the Vice-Chancellor, and be in ſubjection to him. Accordingly the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, with the chief Burgeſſes in Oxford, and the High-Sheriff of Oxfordſhire beſides, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year in a ſolemn manner take an Oath, given by the Vice-Chancellor, to obſerve and conſerve the Rights, Priviledges, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Univerſity of Oxford. And every Year on the tenth of February, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day of <hi>S. Scholaſtica,</hi> a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the principal Burgeſſes, publickly and ſolemnly do pay to each Colledge a Peny, in token of their Submiſſion to the Orders and Rights of the Univerſity.</p>
                        <p>Thus you have a ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as a City and an Univerſity. My next Buſineſs is the Deſcription of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>

                        <p>It is a Place of a large Extent, number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 14 Pariſhes. And, according to Doctor <hi>Fuller's</hi> Obſervation in his Worthies of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, 'tis a Town within an Univerſity, whereas <hi>Oxford</hi> is an Univerſity within a Town. For in <hi>Cambridge</hi> the Colledges are not ſo ſurrounded with Streets as in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but for the generality ſeated in the Skirts of the Town, which afford them the better and more delightfull Walks and Gardens about them.</p>
                        <p>There are in <hi>Oxford</hi> (as I ſaid before) 18 Indowed Colledges, and 7 Halls. In <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> there is but 12 Colledges, and 4 Halls. 'Tis true they are all Indowed, and generally ſo large that the Number of Students is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly little different from that of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Names of them, and of their Founders, together with the Time of their Foundation, you have in the following Table.</p>

                        <p>Here is, as in Oxford, a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> a <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> two <hi>Prectors,</hi> and a <hi>Regiſter.</hi> But the <hi>Chancellor</hi> is not ſo <hi>durante Vita;</hi> for he may be elected every three years, or continue in the ſame Office <hi>durante tacito Conſenſu Senatus Cantabr.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Town is like that of Oxford, ſubject to the Univerſity, and takes a ſolemn Oath, at the Entrance into his Office, to obſerve and conſerve the Priviledges, Liberties, and Cuſtoms thereof.

                        <p>The Univerſity has alſo a <hi>Court-Leet,</hi> held twice every Year, wherein are preſented all Nuſances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What remains is the Queſtion about the Antiquity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> as a Place of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in oppoſition to <hi>Oxford.</hi> To me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be in that reſpect of an older date than Oxford. For <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the time of the Romans, (among whom it was known by the Name of <hi>Camboritum,</hi> or, as ſome Copies have it, <hi>Camboricum,</hi>) was a Roman Colony, mentioned in the beſt Copies among the 28 Cities of Britain. And the Roman Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies had their Schools of Learning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſeveral Profeſſors of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences did inſtruct both the Roman and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Youth. In the Bull of Pope Honorius the firſt, bearing date Febr. 20. 624, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of Priviledges granted to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The <hi>Bull</hi> ſays by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> the 12th Biſhop of Rome, who lived about the latter end of the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, but King Arthur's <hi>Diploma</hi> ſays by
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49236:198"/>Lucius, a Britiſh King, the firſt Chriſtian King in Europe, and Contemporary with the ſaid Eleutherius. Which <hi>Diploma</hi> ſays, that King Lucius was converted by the preaching of the Doctors of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for which reaſon he gave Priviledges to that Univerſity, which were confirmed by King Arthur. Whether the <hi>Diploma</hi> be counterfeit or not, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the aforeſaid Priviledges were granted by King Lucius or Pope Eleutherius, is a Queſtion by it ſelf. Certain is, that both the <hi>Diploma</hi> and the <hi>Bull</hi> agree, in point of Time. So that here is Proof enough, to make it at leaſt probable, that in the time of King Lucius and Pope Eleutherius there might be a ſufficient Number of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men in Cambridge to have inſtructed King Lucius in the Chriſtian Faith; and that Eluanus and Medwinus, who were ſent by that King to Rome for his fuller Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that point, might be of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                        <p>Upon theſe Grounds it muſt be granted, that <hi>Cambridge</hi> is a Place long ſince dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto Learning; and I doubt much whether Oxford (as great a Reſpect as I have for it) can pretend to ſo great an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                        <p>But Dr. Heylin, an Oxonian, alledges a notable Reaſon for the Precedency of <hi>Oxford</hi> before <hi>Cambridge;</hi> Viz. the Reſolution of the Commons in the firſt Parliament held under King James I. For (ſays he) when the Clerk of that Houſe had put the Name of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> before <hi>Oxford,</hi> they taking diſdainfully that <hi>Hyſteron-Proteron</hi> commanded the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both Univerſities to be ſearched, and after ſearch made gave place to Oxford.</p>
                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:49236:199"/>
                        <p>To clear this Point, we muſt take notice, that both <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſince their firſt Foundation, lay for ſeveral Ages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and diſcontinued, during the long Wars of the Saxons and Danes in this Iſland. Till <hi>Oxford</hi> had the happineſs to be firſt reſtored by King Alfred, towards the latter end of the Ninth Century. Which from that time grew into ſuch eſteem, as to be counted one of the four principal Univerſities of Europe, the other three being <hi>Paris</hi> in France, <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> (now <hi>Bologna</hi>) in Italy, and <hi>Salamanca</hi> in Spain. Whereas <hi>Cambridge</hi> did not begin to flouriſh again, till the Reign of Henry I, for his Learning ſurnamed <hi>Beau-Clerc,</hi> that is in the beginning of the Twelfth Century. So that in point of Reſtauration, 'tis plain that <hi>Oxford</hi> has got the ſtart of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But let us leave this Speculation of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> as an Academy, and look upon it as a Title of Honour. In this Point we ſhall find <hi>Cambridge</hi> to have the Preeminency.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49236:202"/>and ſuch as can ſcarce be ſolved. Therefore that wiſe Roman Hiſtorian, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> puts it off with an Ignoramus; <hi>Qui Mortales</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Initio coluerint, parum compertum eſt.</hi> As to the Original of the <hi>Britains</hi> themſelves, <hi>Caeſar</hi> proves them to be derived from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> by their Agreeableneſs in their Making, Speech, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Laws, and Cuſtoms. A rude and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Nation, whoſe Learning (ſuch as it was) was all lockt up in the breaſts of the <hi>Druids,</hi> their Prieſts; who communicated what they knew to none but thoſe of their own Order, and by that means kept the People (much like the Papiſts of our Days) in continual Ignorance of their ſacred Myſteries.</p>
                     <p>The Romans began the Conqueſt of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> about the middle of the firſt Century, and compleated it in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> as far at leaſt as the <hi>Frythes</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Dunbarton</hi> in Scotland; unwilling to venture further, where there was nothing to be got but blows, cold, and hunger. For, as to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> he rather diſcovered than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered England; and his three next Succeſſors, <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> made no Attempt upon it.

Thus <hi>England</hi> came to be wholly poſſeſſed by a new Nation, that is, an aggregate Body of many People amongſt the Germans, who came hither to try their fortune.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>At laſt, in the eleventh Century, the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (a Northern People of France) came in with their Duke <hi>William.</hi> Who in one Battel got his pretended Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and from a ſingle Victory the Title of <hi>Conquerour.</hi> Now the <hi>Normans</hi> mixing (as they did) with the Body of this Nation, we may ſay, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bloud at this day is a Mixture chiefly of <hi>Saxon, Dane,</hi> and <hi>Norman,</hi> not without a Tincture of <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Blood.</p>

                     <p>The Women generally more handſom than in other Places, and without Sophiſtications ſufficiently indowed with natural beauties. In an abſolute Woman, ſay the Italians, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Parts of a Dutch-Woman from the Waſte downwards; of a French-Woman, from the Waſte up to the Shoulders; and over them an Engliſh Pace. Therefore an Engliſh-Woman makes one of the ſix Things wherein England excels, comprehended in this Latine Verſe,

                     </p>
                     <p>That is to ſay, For Mountains, Bridges, Rivers, Churches fair, Women, and Wool, <hi>England</hi> is paſt Compare.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, there is no Country in Europe where Youth is generally ſo charming, Men ſo proper and well proportioned, and Women ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                     <p>The Truth is, this Happineſs is not only to be attributed to the Clemency of the Air. Their eaſy Life unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

A fit Subject therefore for that Sex, which is ſo tender of Beauty, to chew upon.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh <hi>Temper</hi> is naturally ſutable to their Climate. They are neither ſo fiery a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Miſchief is, that by their different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts both in Civil Matters and Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they are apt to be divided into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which takes off very much from their Happineſs. After ſo great a Deliverance as they were lately bleſſed with, who would have thought that there ſhould be now a Party, (tho incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable) which repineth at it? And that a Proteſtant Party; who, like the Iſraelites, have a lingering Mind after the Onions of Egypt. Brought as they are out of Captivity by the wounderful hand of Providence into a happy ſtate of Liberty, they grumble, and weary of their happineſs ſeem willing to exchange their Moſes for a Pharaoh. Were none but they concerned in the Change, 'tis pity but they ſhould have it, and be cruſhed into Common Senſe. They put me in mind of thoſe ſilly Women in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovy, (which according to Olearius) fancy their Husbands love them beſt that whip 'em moſt.</p>

                        </gap>o where ſo affronted as it is amongſt them. Whether I look upon thoſe that die privately in their Beds, or publickly upon a Scaffold or Gibet, I ſee ſo much Unconcernedneſs, that 'tis a wonder how a Nation that lives in ſo much caſe ſhould value their Lives ſo little. In point of Fighting, 'tis true they are not altogether ſo haſty as the French to fight out a ſingle Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>el. But 'tis not ſo much for want of Courage,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49236:204"/>as out of reſpect to the Laws, which are ſevere upon thoſe that break the Peace.</p>
                     <p>For, upon a publick Account, when Men fight with Authority, no Nation ſhew's more forwardneſs. As they are a free People, their Spirits are accordingly averſe from Slavery, and as greedy of Glory. Their Fore fathers Exploits, which by oral Tradition, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hiſtories, they are generally pretty well acquainted with, adds much to their Courage, But eſpecially the Notion of their Conqueſt of France is ſo univerſally ſpread all over the Nation, and their Antipathy againſt the French ſo great and univerſal, that one may reaſonably expect a good Succeſs from their firſt Attempt upon France, when Opportunity ſhall ſerve. For deſperate Attempts no Nation like the Engliſh, either by Sea or Land. If they be bent upon Fighting, they go to it undaunted, without telling the Number, or valuing the Strength of their Enemies. With this bold and undaunted Courage, not common with other Nations, they have ſometimes outdone the very Romans themſelves; and for this I appeal particularly to the Hiſtory of France, where with a hand-full of Men they have rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defeated the braveſt Armies.

                     <p>For a further Proof of the Engliſh Valour, I might recount their Victories of old over the Iriſh, Scots, Cypriots, and Turks. And Spain it ſelf has ſufficiently experienced both by Sea and Land the Engliſh Valour, to its coſt; but by Sea eſpecially. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Battel <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. where Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, with a few Ships, vanquiſhed the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Fleet, which for the greatneſs of it was called <hi>Invincible.</hi> Sir Francis Drake, the Year before that, had with four Ships only took from the Spaniard one Million and 189200 Ducats in one Voyage. And afterwards with 25 Ships he awed the Ocean, ſacked S. Jago, S. Dominico, and Carthagena; carrying away with him, beſides Treaſure, 240 Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Sr. Richard Greenvile, Captain of one of the Queens Ships called the Revenge, with 180 Souldiers (whereof 90 were diſabled with Sickneſs) maintained a Sea-fight for 24 hours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an incredible Number of the Spaniſh Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, ſunk four of the greateſt, and killed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands of their Men. Till at laſt, her Powder being ſpent to the laſt Barrel, ſhe yielded upon honourable Terms, yet was never brought into Spain. To this I ſhall add the famous Adventure of John Oxenham an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman, one of the Followers of Sr. Francis Drake, in the Weſt Indies. Where being land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſmall Barque, with 70 of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, a little above <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> in the Iſthmus of Panama, he drew his Barque on Land, covered it with Boughs, and marched over the Land with his Company, guided by Negroes, till he came to a River. There he cut down Wood, to make him a Pinnace; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he entred the South Sea, and went to the Iſle of Pearls. About which Iſland in few days
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49236:205"/>he ſurprized two Spaniſh Ships, with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Treaſure of Gold and Silver, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in ſafety to the Land. An Adventure not to be forgotten, and recorded by Spaniſh Writers with much admiration; ſo bold was the Attempt, ſo ſtrange the Succeſs, and ſo prodigious the Booty.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things I thought fit to record, now this is a Time for Action. We have a great Enemy to incounter with, the Iriſh, but only great by their Numbers. 'Tis but fighting with Cyphers. But with the French there is both Laurels and Booty to be got. And, if the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Souldiery will but ſeriouſly reflect how much this Nation has been in the late Reigns abuſed and undermined by Them, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they were formerly, I doubt not but with Gods Bleſſing and their natural Courage, under the Conduct of a magnanimous King and of a great General, they will right themſelves, and be a glorious Inſtrument for the ſetling the Peace of Europe upon a ſure and laſting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                     <p>The Character of Pride which <hi>Scaliger</hi> gives the Engliſh Nation,
<note n="*" place="margin">Scaliger <hi>de Re Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.</note> when he calls them <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatos &amp; Contemptores,</hi> is a Character common to moſt Nations, but to none ſo well adapted as to his own. For the French, like the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans of old, look upon moſt other Nations as barbarous, and count themſelves the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. I confeſs they have great many good Qualifications, but this preſumptuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſpoils all. And, all Things being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, if the Engliſh have a little Pride, it is perhaps the beſt grounded of any Nation.</p>
                     <p>Cruelty and Barbarity, which the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor charges 'em with, when he calls them <hi>Inhoſpitales, Immanes,</hi> is a meer Phantaſm of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49236:205"/>own. 'Tis true, the Engliſh are not ſo fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the French upon Strangers, becauſe they can make better ſhift without them; but I hope they don't want common Civility. They have indeed ſome thing of a natural Antipathy againſt the French, as there is to this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the French and the Spaniards. Yet, when the French Proteſtants fled to them for Refuge in the late Perſecution, the ſtrength of their Charity overcame their Nature. They laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their inbred Prejudices, and forthwith made it their buſineſs to relieve them as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who ſuffered for their Religion. How mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate they have been towards the plotting Papiſts, I leave the World to judge. Had the Huguenots of France plotted againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there, as the Papiſts have done here ever ſince the Reformation, what do you think could have expiated their Crime? Nothing but a quick and general Maſſacre, ſuch as they ſuffered under Charles IX, without the leaſt Provocation. The late Experience tells us, what Spirit of Cruelty has poſſeſſed the French; when, upon the Kings Proteſtant Subjects ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Submiſſion to him in Civil Matters, and his moſt ſolemn and ſacred Ingagements to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Liberties, this very Prince (whom they had lifted upon the Throne, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Bloud) contrary to Equity and the Laws of the Land, to his Oaths and Promiſes, and to the Rules of Gratitude and Humanity, let them looſe to the Cruelty of his Apoſtolick Dragoons; by whom they were cruſhed, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and uſed beyond the Barbarity of the very Heathens themſelves.

                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> alive, what could he ſay to all this? How could he anſwer the late cruel Burnings and Devaſtations the French made in Germany, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of War, and the very Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the moſt barbarous Nations? And what could he ſay to their genteel Way of Poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein they have been of late ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the Engliſh ſo dull?</p>
                     <p>But, to clear further the Engliſh from that foul Imputation of Cruelty and Barbarity, if we look upon their Plantations abroad, who more courteous and gentle than this Nation? If we inſpect their Proceedings againſt Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, no Nation in the World ſhews ſo much humanity, or proceeds with more equity. The barbarous Uſe of Racks, apt to extort Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion right or wrong, is abſolutely laid aſide amongſt us. Nothing but the Priſoners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Confeſſion, or the Depoſition of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon Oath made out with good Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, will take a Mans Life away. The Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Wheel, and other like torturing Deaths, are lookt upon here as too cruel for Chriſtians to uſe. Neither are the Criminals, who with their Lives have expiated their Crimes before the World, denied Chriſtian Burial, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in particular Caſes.</p>
                     <p>All this ſhews a great deal of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and averſeneſs from Cruelty. And, if we look upon the Engliſh in their private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, there we ſhall find a greater Harmony than perhaps in any Nation. For here generally Husbands are the moſt Kind to their Wives, Wives as tender of their Husbands, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents indulgent to Children. The firſt is ſo great a Truth, that England is every where acknowledged to be the Paradiſe of Women, as it is the Hell of Horſes. And it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49236:206"/>By-Word among the Italians, that, if there were a Bridge over the Narrow Seas, all the Women of Europe would run into England. For here they are neither ſo ſervilely ſubmiſſive as the French, nor ſo jealouſly garded as the Italian. Here they have the upper hand in the Streets, the upper place at Table, the Thirds of their Husbands Eſtates, and in many Caſes ſhare in all Lands.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh I could clear the Engliſh aſwell from Wantonneſs and Debauchery, as I have from Cruelty. But, if they have too much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this point from their Anceſtors, the Reaſon of it is at hand,
<q>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, if that Rule be conſtantly true, we have now the faireſt Proſpect of a Reformation that ever Nation had, and the greateſt Reaſon to hope ſhortly to ſee the Engliſh, now under a ſober and religious (as well as a warlike) Prince, recover their Reputation, which has been ſo long obſcured by the Licentiouſneſs of two effeminate Reigns.</p>
                     <p>From their Temper I proceed to their <hi>Genius,</hi> wherein our Characterizer is no leſs abuſive. And one would think his too much Learning made him mad, when he calls the Engliſh no leſs than <hi>ſtolidos, amentes, inertes,</hi> that is, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and dull. The Truth is, other Nations are as deeply ingaged as the Engliſh againſt him in this Quarrel, of whom he gives like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an unmanly Character. But, to confute him in this Point, this I dare aver, that no Nation has been more induſtrious than the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in Mechanick Arts, and the World to this day is obliged to them for many of their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49236:207"/>Inventions and Diſcoveries. For Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing and Navigation, no People can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with them but the Hollanders, and their great Wealth ariſing from thence is a plain Proof and Demonſtration of it. For Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially ſince the Reformation, there is no Nation in the World ſo generally knowing. And, as Experimental Philoſophy, ſo Divinity both Scholaſtick and Practical has been Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved here beyond all other Places. Which makes Forein Divines, and the beſt ſort of them, ſo converſant with the learned Works of thoſe famous Lights of the Church, our beſt Engliſh Divines.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Engliſh <hi>Genius</hi> is for cloſe Speaking and Writing, and always to the Point. They look upon looſe and rambling Diſcourſes with contempt and indignation, tho' they be ſeaſoned with never ſo much wit. The gawdy part and pomp of Rhetorick, ſo much affected by the French, is ſlighted by the Engliſh; who, like Men of Reaſon, ſtick chiefly to Logick. And what they ſpeak in publick they deliver it with a Gravity ſutable to the Subject, ſlighting thoſe mimical Geſticulations ſo much uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, and indeavouring not ſo much to move the Hearer's Affections as to convince his Reaſon. <hi>Gutta cavat Lapidem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Nation perhaps is more <hi>Satyrical,</hi> and quicker in <hi>Repartees,</hi> but ſtill with much gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I have often wondered at the Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome of the common Sort, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues more Wit than our Cenſurer allow's.</p>
                     <p>To expreſs themſelves ſignificantly, and with the greateſt advantages, they have a moſt happy <hi>Language,</hi> tho' (like their Bloud) it be but a Mixture. For it is a Compound
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49236:207"/>chiefly of theſe three, <hi>Saxon, Latine,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> but ſo that the <hi>Saxon</hi> is the Stock, in which the other two are Ingrafted.</p>
                     <p>As for the Excellency of it, I have little to add to what has been lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Miege</hi> in his Prefatory Diſcourſe to his <hi>Engliſh Grammar.</hi> The Excellency (ſays he) of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tongue conſiſts in theſe four Things, viz. its <hi>Facility, Copiouſneſs, Significancy,</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its <hi>Facility</hi> is eaſily demonſtrable in its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Flexions, from that Multiplicity of Caſes, and other Variations, which an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls the Emblems of Babel's Curſe and Confuſion. The Invariableneſs of its Nouns Adjective makes their Concordance eaſy with the Subſtantives. The Pronouns, ſo puzzling and intricate in French, admit of little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Engliſh; and what is more eaſy than the Conjugation of Engliſh Verbs? Inſtead of one Particle <hi>(To)</hi> uſed before the Infinitive, the French have no leſs than three Prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>de, a</hi> and <hi>pour,</hi> differently uſed in that Mood. Nor is the Engliſh troubled with Verbs Reciprocal, one of the hardeſt Ingredients of that Language; eſpecially when uſed with an Interrogation, and theſe intricate Particles <hi>en, y, ne,</hi> and <hi>pas,</hi> the right placing of which is ſo puzzling to Strangers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Copiouſneſs</hi> I need not uſe much art to demonſtrate. For, beſides the Treaſures of the old Saxon which the Engliſh retains in its Monoſyllables, the choicer Wits of the Nation have fetcht hither the very Quinteſſence of ſome forein Languages; who, like Bees, have gathered the beſt, and left the worſt. By which means they have ſo happily improved their Mother-Tongue, that thoſe amongſt Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners who underſtand the Genius of it are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49236:208"/>in a maze to ſee this Language ſo far outdo their own, and to find many of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Words thrive better in England than in their proper and natural Soil. And, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the French is ſtinted, and grown barren through its exceeding Nicety, the Engliſh on the contrary is grown mighty Copious, by its innate Liberty of making ſuch Compounds and Derivatives as are proper and ſutable to abridge the Expreſſion, and to ſay <hi>Multum in parvo.</hi> Inſomuch that it do's almoſt equalize the Greek, and even exceed the Latine, in a peculiar grace of compounding Words toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is one of the greateſt Beauties that can be in a Language. Nor do's its Abundance ly here altogether; there being Court and Country Engliſh, and peculiar Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects (beſides the general one) in the Weſt and North Countries. In ſhort, no Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can deliver a Matter with more Variety, either plainly by Synonima's, or by Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with Metaphors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Significancy</hi> of the Engliſh is made out to my hand by the <hi>Vindex Anglicus,</hi> in Words to this effect. There is ſcarce, ſays he, any Variety that any other Nation can brag of, but the Engliſh has almoſt with equal felicity made its own. Witneſs the <hi>Italian Courtier,</hi> the <hi>French Saluſt,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Guzman,</hi> the <hi>Latine Naſo,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Polybius.</hi> Whoever reads that matchleſs Eſſay of Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> upon the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> would think it writ ſo by the peerleſs <hi>Maro</hi> himſelf. How properly has the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> taught us to ſpeak the Terms of Art in our own Language? A Thing Judged impoſſible, till we ſaw it performed. What matchleſs and incomparable Pieces have we ſeen in our Time, and where ſhall one ſee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49236:208"/>more ſenſe in ſo few Words? What Poetry has more Majeſty, and bears a greater ſenſe than the Engliſh, when it flows from a true Poet?</p>
                     <p>In point of <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> whereas the <hi>Italian</hi> ſwarms with Vowels, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> has the Advantage of them both in a happy Mixture. 'Tis true, the <hi>Italian</hi> is an excellent, Princely, and pleaſant Language; but it wants Sinews, and paſſes as ſilent Water. The <hi>French</hi> is truly delicate, but ſomething too nice and affected; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſtical, but terrible and boiſterous; the <hi>Dutch</hi> manly, but harſh. Now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is both ſweet, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 'Tis true, there are in it ſome particular ſounds unknown to the French Tongue; which are indeed ſomething harſh and uncouth in the mouth of a French Learner, and yet very ſmooth when they run in their proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Channel. Viz. <hi>i</hi> long, as in <hi>Vice; ou</hi> and <hi>ow,</hi> in <hi>Cloud, Vow,</hi>  
                        <hi>o</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> as in <hi>God, Lord, bird,</hi> and <hi>ſhirt,</hi> pronounced with a mixt ſound of the French <hi>o</hi> and <hi>a.</hi> But thoſe which puzzle moſt of all the French Learner are the found of <hi>g</hi> before <hi>e</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> and (which is the ſame Thing,) of <hi>j</hi> Conſonant before any Vowel, as in <hi>ginger, jack, jeſt, jil, jog,</hi> and <hi>jug;</hi> of <hi>ch,</hi> as in <hi>Chamber;</hi> but chiefly of <hi>th,</hi> called a <hi>t</hi> aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as in <hi>thanks, thief, thorough, thunder,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, ſuch is the mixture of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that one may frame his Speech majeſtical, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, delicate, or manly, according to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Of all which Advantages inherent to the Engliſh Tongue Foreiners are at laſt become very ſenſible. For, whereas they uſed to ſlight it as an Inſular Speech, not worth their taking notice, they are at preſent great Admirers of it.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49236:209"/>
                     <p>What remains is to anſwer the uſual <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> againſt it, whereby ſome People pretend to degrade it from the Worth of a Language, viz. its <hi>Mixture,</hi> and <hi>Mutability. Mixture,</hi> a Thing ſo very natural to Languages, that none but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> (if that) is free from it. The <hi>Latine</hi> it ſelf had a great Mixture of Greek and Gothiſh. The <hi>French</hi> conſiſts of Latine, Dutch, and old Gallick. The <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> of Latine, Gothiſh, and Moriſco. And the <hi>German</hi> it ſelf, as Original as it is pretended to be, has a taſte of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, and the bordering Neighbours. As for its <hi>Mutability,</hi> 'tis at leaſt as groundleſs an Objection. For 'tis well known, that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as States, have their Infancy and Age, their Wax and Wane.</p>
                     <p>But now the Engliſh Tongue is come to ſo great Perfection, now 'tis grown ſo very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Significant, by the acceſſion of the quinteſſence and life of other Tongues, 'twere to be wiſhed that a ſtop were put to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Way of Naturalizing forein Words, and that none hereafter ſhould be admitted but with Judgement and Authority. For the Truth is, there is as much in it as is needful, and as much as the Engliſh Soil is well able to bear.</p>
                     <p>I conclude, according to the Title of this Chapter, with an Account of the moſt <hi>famous Men</hi> of this Nation, either for Souldiery or Learning, extracted from Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy. Which will ſerve as a further Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Hypercritick <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and other French conceited Authors ſince his Time, who valuing no Nation but their own, made it their Buſineſs to decry the Engliſh. But I ſhall do it with my Author's Caution, that is, without
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49236:209"/>mentioning the late great Men this Nation has bred, that I may give no ground for Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs.</p>

                        <p>But I cannot paſs by the remarkable Story of the foreſaid Dr. <hi>John Raynolds,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> his Brother. <hi>William</hi> was at firſt a Proteſtant of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49236:210"/>the Church of England, and <hi>John</hi> trained up beyond Sea in Popery. The firſt, out of an honeſt Zeal to reduce his Brother, made a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to him, and they had a Conference. Where it ſo fell out, that each was overcome with his Brothers Arguments; ſo that <hi>William</hi> of a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Proteſtant became a virulent Papiſt, and <hi>John</hi> of a ſtrong Papiſt a moſt rigid Proteſtant.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Engliſh</hi> Names, <hi>and of their Way of</hi> Computing.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>CHriſtian Names, ſays <hi>Cambden,</hi> were firſt impoſed for the Diſtinction of Perſons; Surnames, for the Diſtinction of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, amongſt the Engliſh, are either Saxon; as <hi>Edward, Gilbert, Henry, Richard, Walter, William,</hi> &amp;c. Or taken out of the Holy Writ; as <hi>Abraham, Jacob, James, Jſaac,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>'Tis rare for the Engliſh to have two Chriſten Names together, as they have in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. But it is not unuſual with them to chriſten Children by their Godfathers Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, which is unpractiſed beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients took particular care to give their Children ſignificative and good Names, according to the Proverb, <hi>Bonum Nomen, Bonum Omen.</hi> And the Pythagoreans affirmed the Minds, Actions, and Succeſſes of Men to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Fate, Genius, and Name. In ſhort, ſuch was Mens Superſtition of old in this particular, that they uſed a kind of Divination by Names, called <hi>Onomantia,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the laſt General Council.</p>
                     <p>The Story of Auguſtus the Emperour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable upon this Subject. The Day before his Sea-fight at <hi>Actium,</hi> the firſt Man he met was a poor Man, driving his Aſs before him. Auguſtus demanded his Name; and he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49236:212"/>
                        <hi>Eutyches,</hi> that is, Happy-man; then he asked his Aſſe's Name, which proved to be <hi>Nicon,</hi> that is, Victor. Auguſtus took it for a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and having accordingly obtained the Victory, there he built <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> or the City of Victory, and erected brazen Images of the Man and his Aſs.</p>
                     <p>Alfonſo IV. King of Caſtille had two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by one of the Daughters of Henry II. King of England. The Eldeſt, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> by Name, was far ſurpaſſing her Siſter <hi>Blanche</hi> in beauty. Lewis VIII. of France ſent to Alfonſo, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one of the Daughters. They were both preſented to the Ambaſſadors Choice; who, inquiring of their Names, preferred the Lady <hi>Blanche,</hi> and made choice of her, contrary to all expectation. The Name of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> though the more beautiful Lady, proved unpleaſing; and that of the Lady <hi>Blanche,</hi> ſignifying Fair and Beautiful, carried it, as a Name that would be more acceptable in France.</p>
                     <p>For my part, though I am not ſo much a Pythagorean as to think a Mans Name ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret his Fate; yet I think it not amiſs to name Children with Names of a happy ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as it was uſual among the Primitive Chriſtians, were it but to ſtir them up to live according to their Names, and not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the lie.</p>
                     <p>As for the Engliſh <hi>Surnames,</hi> they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Saxon,</hi> ſome few Daniſh, as <hi>Whitfeld,</hi> and <hi>Wren.</hi> The <hi>Whitfelds,</hi> a very ancient Family, came over with King <hi>Canute</hi> into England; and their chief Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the Surnames now of beſt account in England are Local, and ſo were many Names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans. Thoſe you will find deduced from Places in Normandy, or Countries adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; being either the Patrimonial Poſſeſſions, or native Places of ſuch as ſerved the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or came in after out of Normandy. As <hi>Mortimer, Albigny, Percy, Gournay, Devereux, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Ferrers, Montfort, Courtney, Creſſy,</hi> &amp;c. Or from Places in England, and Scotland; as <hi>Barkley, Clifford, Lumley, Ratcliff, Willoughby, Douglas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of which Local Names were formerly uſed with <hi>de,</hi> prefixt; but of late generally neglected, or joyned to the Name, as <hi>Darcy, Devereux.</hi> Others had <hi>at</hi> prefixed, as <hi>At More, At Wood, At Down,</hi> which has been removed from ſome, and has been conjoyned to others, as in theſe, <hi>Atmore, Atwood, Atwells,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Many have alſo had their Names from Rivers, as <hi>Trent, Eden, Swale, Stoure.</hi> From Trees near their Habitations, as <hi>Oak, Box, Elder, Beech.</hi> Some from their Situation in reſpect to adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places; as <hi>North, South, East, Weſt,</hi> according to the Greek Names <hi>Anatolius, Zephyrius,</hi> &amp;c. Others from ſeveral Parts of a Houſe; as <hi>Hall, Parlour, Cellar, Lodge,</hi> &amp;c. From Towns where they were born, or from whence they came, without being Lords or Poſſeſſors of them; as <hi>Compton, Egerton.</hi> Or from ſeveral Denominations of Land and Water, as <hi>Hill, Wood, Warren, Field, Ford, Pool,</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among Foreiners, ſeveral retained the Names of their Countries; as <hi>Scot, Picard, Fleming, French, Lombard, Poitevin, German.</hi> And theſe had commonly <hi>Le</hi> prefixt in Records, and other Writings, as <hi>Le Fleming, Le Picard.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49236:214"/>Peters, Davis, Harris, Roberts, Simonds, Guyſe, Stephens, Richards, Hughs, Jones,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Many likewiſe have been made by adjoyning <hi>Kins</hi> to thoſe Nurſe-Names, making them as it were Diminutives: As <hi>Dickins</hi> from <hi>Dicks, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> from Peir for Peter, <hi>Tomkins</hi> from Tom, <hi>Wilkins</hi> from Will, <hi>Lambkins</hi> from Lambert, <hi>Hobkins</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi> from <hi>Hob, Atkins</hi> from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur, <hi>Jenkins</hi> from John, <hi>Watkins</hi> from Wat, <hi>Tipkins</hi> from Tibald, <hi>Daukins</hi> from Davy. And ſo did the Romans vary their Names; as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, Conſtantius, Conſtantinus, Juſtus, Juſtulus, Juſtinus, Juſtinianus, Aurelius, Aureolus, Aurelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Auguſtus, Auguſtinus, Auguſtinianus, Auguſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe, by adding <hi>ins</hi> to curtailed Names; as <hi>Hutchins, Huggins, Hitchins,</hi> and <hi>Higgins</hi> from Hugh, <hi>Gibbins</hi> from Gibby, <hi>Jennings</hi> from John, and <hi>Rawlins</hi> from Raoul, that is, Ralph.</p>
                     <p>To which add Diminutive Surnames, ending in <hi>et</hi> or <hi>ot;</hi> as <hi>Willet</hi> from Will, <hi>Bartlet</hi> from Bartholomew, <hi>Millet</hi> from Miles, <hi>Huet</hi> from Hugh, <hi>Eliot</hi> from Elias.</p>
                     <p>But you will find many more of theſe Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive Surnames, by the addition of <hi>Son,</hi> to the Father's Chriſtian or Nickname.

                     <p>What remains is to anſwer the Queſtion, how people came by their Names. <hi>Cambden</hi> thinks (as it is probable enough) that ſome took up their Names themſelves, and others had their Names given them by the People, in whom lies the Sovereignty of Words and Names. Amongſt the firſt he reckons thoſe that aſſumed local Names of ſuch Places as they were Owners of. And, amongſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the laſt, eſpecially the Diminutives, he brings in the Nurſes as the principal.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it improbable, ſay's he, but that many Names, that ſeem unfitting for Men, as thoſe of brutiſh Beaſts, &amp;c. came from the very Signs of the Houſes where they inhabited. And he alledges for Inſtance ſome that, living at the Sign of the Dolphin, Bull, and White-Horſe, were commonly called <hi>Thomas</hi> at the <hi>Dolphin, Will</hi> at the <hi>Bull, George</hi> at the <hi>White-Horſe.</hi> Which Names (as many others of the like ſort) with omitting <hi>At,</hi> became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hereditary to their Children.</p>
                     <p>Another Thing obſervable in Names is their frequent Change, a Thing practiſed of old by the Romans themſelves. For ſome have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Names, to avoid the Opinion of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; others, in remembrance of their more honourable Progenitors. Some upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Adoption, others in remembrance of ſome particular Favours. Some again, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Names of thoſe whoſe Lands they had; and others, by taking the Name of their own Office. As when <hi>Edward Fitz-Theobald</hi> was made <hi>Butler</hi> of Ireland, the Earls of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49236:215"/>and others deſcended from them, took the Name of <hi>Butler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Pride of Scholars has alſo wrought Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in ſome Names. And the fear of Puniſhment has been all along the Occaſion of ſeveral Mens changing their Names, to avoid being diſcovered. But Time eſpecially has changed Names the moſt, by contracting, curtailing, and mollifying of them in ſuch a manner, that they are quite another Thing from what they were at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Foreiners may obſerve, that Women in England at their Marriage change their Surnames, and paſs into their Husbands Names. Which is but reaſonable, becauſe married peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Non ſunt duo, ſed Caro una,</hi> they are but one Fleſh. And yet in France, and elſewhere, married Women retain ſo far their own Names with their Husbands, as to write themſelves by their Fathers Surnames.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the Engliſh Way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting. Who do not begin the Year till the 25th of March, being the Day of Chriſt's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; wherein they agree with Spain. This is the Rule, both in Church and State; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they date all their publick Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Though, according to the Cycles of the Sun and Moon, they allow the Year to begin only the firſt of January; which therefore is by them called, as by moſt other Chriſtians in Europe, the New-Years Day. And, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh that mongrel Time from the firſt of January to the 25th of March following, 'tis uſual with many, in the Dates of their Letters during that Interval, to ſet down both the Years thus, as from the 1ſt of January 1688. to the 25th of March 1689/90</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49236:215"/>
                     <p>As for the Natural Day, conſiſting of 24 hours, the Engliſh begin (as moſt Parts of Europe do) at Midnight, counting 12 hours to Noon the next Day, and 12 hours more to next Midnight; according to the Cuſtom of the Egyptians, and ancient Romans. Whereas in ſome other Countries, as Italy, Poland, and Bohemia, they reckon 24 hours together, from Sun-ſet to Sun-ſet, which muſt needs be very troubleſom to tell after the Clock. In Moſcovy, and ſome Places in Germany (as Nuremberg, and Wirtemberg) they begin the Day and end it with the Sun; ſo that the firſt Hour of the Day is with them at Sun riſe, and the firſt hour of the Night at Sun-ſet, which is according to the old Babylonian Account.</p>
                     <p>The Old Style is uſed in England, as in moſt Proteſtant States; and the New Style, in all Popiſh States. According to this Style, theſe reckon ten Days before us regularly, as to the beginning of Months, and all fixt Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; but for all moveable Feaſts, the Account proves various.</p>
                     <p>The Old Style is otherwiſe called the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Account,</hi> from <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> who, 43 Years before our Saviours Birth, ordained the Year to conſiſt of 365 Days and 6 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ours. And, as theſe 6 hours, at 4 Years end, make up 24 hours, therefore a Day is then added to the Month of February; and that Year called Leap Year, or Biſſextile Year, from the Latine <hi>Biſſextilis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The New Style is otherwiſe termed the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian Account,</hi> from <hi>Pope Gregory XIII;</hi> who, above 100 Years ago, undertook to correct the Calendar, by the advice and direction of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Lilius, and other excellent Mathematicians. For, tho the Julian Account for many Ages ſeemed to have no ſenſible Errour; yet it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49236:216"/>at laſt diſcovered to be not altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the natural Motion of the Sun. In ſhort, it was made out, that the Julian Year exceeded the true Solar Year by 10 Minutes and 48 Seconds; whereby the Equinoxes and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices yearly changed their places, and flew back ſo many minutes and ſeconds. Therefore Pope Gregory ordered the Year to conſiſt of 365 Days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 12 ſeconds. And, that the Vernal Equinox (which then was on the 11th of March) might be reduced to the 21th, as it was at the time of the firſt Nicene Council, he commanded ten Days in October to be left out, by calling the fifth Day thereof the fifteenth.</p>
                     <p>To find Eaſter, the Church of <hi>England</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſtill the Cycle found out and finiſhed in the ſixth Century by that worthy Roman, <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> or <hi>Abas.</hi> Whereas the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, having invented new Rules about Eaſter, it happens ſometimes that their Eaſter is full five Weeks before ours, ſometimes with, but never after ours.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Engliſh Way of Living, as to Lodging, Fewel, Food, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Exerciſe, Recreations, and ſome particular Cuſtoms.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen I compare the Modern Engliſh Way of <hi>Building</hi> with the Old Way, I cannot but wonder at the Genius of old Times. Nothing is more delightful and convenient than Light, nothing more agreeable to health than a free Air. And yet of old they uſed to dwell in Houſes, moſt with a blind Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, low Cielings, and dark Windows; the Rooms built at random, often with Steps from one to another. So that one would think the Men of former Ages were afraid of Light and good Air, or loved to play at Hide and Seek. Whereas the Genius of our time is altogether for lightſom Stair-Caſes, fine Saſh-Windows, and lofty Cielings. And ſuch has been of late our Builders Induſtry, in point of Compactneſs and Uniformity, that a Houſe after the new Way will afford upon the ſame Quantity of Ground as many more Conveniences.</p>
                     <p>The Contrivance of Cloſets in moſt Rooms, and the painted Wainſcotting now ſo much u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are alſo two great Improvements; the one for Conveniency, the other for Cleanneſs and Health. And indeed, for ſo damp a Country as <hi>England</hi> is, nothing could be better contrived
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49236:217"/>than Wainſcot, to keep off the ill Impreſſion of damp Walls. In ſhort, for handſom Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Neatneſs of Lodgings, <hi>London</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly has got the preeminence.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Objection againſt the London-Houſes (being for the moſt part Brick) is their Slightneſs, occaſioned by the Fines exacted by the Landlords. So that few Houſes, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rate of Building, laſt longer than the Ground-Leaſe, that is about 50 or 60 Years. In the mean time, if there happens to be a long fit of exceſſive Heat in Summer or Cold in Winter, the Walls being but thin, become at laſt ſo penetrated with the Air, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt needs be uneaſy with it. But thoſe Extreams happen but ſeldom. And this Way of Building is wonderful beneficial to all Trades relating to it; for they never want Work in ſo great a City, where Houſes here and there are always repairing, or building up again.</p>
                     <p>The plaiſtered <hi>Cielings,</hi> ſo much uſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> beyond all other Countries, make by their Whiteneſs the Rooms ſo much lightſomer, and are excellent againſt a raging Fire. They ſtop the paſſage of Duſt, and leſſen the Noiſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. In Summer-time the Air of the Room is ſomething the cooler for't, and the warmer in Winter.</p>
                     <p>The Uſe of <hi>Stoves,</hi> ſo common in Northern Countries, as Germany, Denmark, Sueden, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Moſcovy, and even ſo far Southward as Swiſſerland, is in a manner unknown in this Country. And indeed its Temperateneſs does no way require it. Therefore the Engliſh uſe no outward Remedy againſt Cold Weather but a Chimney-Fire, which is both comfortable to the Body, and chearful to the Sight. 'Tis true,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49236:217"/>there is a double Conveniency in Stoves. Firſt in point of Savingneſs, for once heating of a Stove in the Morning, keeps the Room warm a whole Day. Secondly, in Point of Warmth, the Room being ſo warm with it, that all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in it feel the benefit thereof. But thoſe two Conveniences are more than over-ballanced by one Inconveniency, <hi>viz.</hi> the aptneſs of Stoves to gather and foment all the noiſom Smells of a Room for want of Vent, which muſt needs be very unwholſom; whereas a Chimney-fire draws 'em to it, and there they find vent with the Smoak. To that Inconveniency we may add the chilling Impreſſions of a cold and ſharp Air, upon ones coming into it out of ſo warm a Room as commonly Stove-rooms are. Beſides the Cumberſomneſs of Stoves in Summer-time, when being altogether uſeleſs, they take up a great deal of room to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Fewel,</hi> England affords three Sorts, Wood, Coals, and Turves; but Coals is the moſt common, in London eſpecially, where they have 'em by Sea from Newcaſtle and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland. A laſting ſort of Fewel, being a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſmall and round Coals together, which by their aptneſs to cake, is the moſt durable of any; and for Kitchin Uſe, far beyond Wood it ſelf, as yielding not only a more even, but more piercing Heat. The Smoak of it is indeed groſſer, and of a corroſive nature; but yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo offenſive to the Eye, whatever it is to the Lungs, as ſome pretend it to be. In many Parts of the Country they have Pit-coals, which is a cleaner and more chearful Fewel, but not ſo durable as Sea-coals. But the Cheapneſs of theſe at London in Time of Peace is worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice; where for ſo ſmall a matter as two or three pence a Day one may keep a conſtant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49236:218"/>moderate Fire from Morning till Bed-time. Which is a mighty Advantage to ſo vaſt and populous a Place, eſpecially conſidering it comes 300 miles by Sea. And whatever the Pariſians can ſay to the praiſe of their Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, I dare ſay the common ſort of People there would be glad, could they compaſs it, to change in Winter-time Fewel with the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh <hi>Diet</hi> falls next under our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; which for the eating part, does moſt conſiſt in Fleſh, and chiefly in Butchers Meat. For, though they have great Plenty and Variety of Fiſh and Fowl, Roots and Herbs, yet they are moſt commonly uſed but as a Supplement or an Acceſſory to the Principal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engliſh ever went amongſt Strangers for the greateſt Fleſh-eaters. Which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the beſt, and the moſt proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this Country.</p>
                     <p>But, whereas formerly the Engliſh uſed to eat three or Four Meals a Day, the generality of them, ſince the long Civil Wars in the Reign of Char. I. have uſed themſelves to eat but one Meal a Day. If then they eat plentifully, and perhaps beyond the rate of other People, who eat three or four times a Day, it is no matter of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some thing more than ordinary muſt be laid up in ſtore, to hold out 24 Hours. There is the leſs Time loſt in eating, and the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Buſineſs. So that, if other Nations live to eat, the Engliſh may be ſaid to eat only to live. In ſhort, all things conſidered, we may reckon the Engliſh, (who heretofore were perhaps not unjuſtly taxed of Gluttony, and to be a People moſt given to their Bellies) to be now one of the moſt ſober Nations of Europe, as to Eating.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49236:218"/>
                     <p>Not but that in their Feaſtings, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, they are as great as any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Witneſs (for publick ones) the Feaſts at Coronations, at the Inſtallation of the Knights of the Garter, Conſecration of Biſhops, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Embaſſadors, the Feaſts of the Lord Mayor of London, of Sergeants at Law, and of Readers in the Inns of Court. And yet, as ſumptuous and magnificent as they are in theſe Times, they are not to compare to the wonderful Feaſtings of elder Times. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded (ſays Dr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi>) of Richard Earl of Cornwal, Brother to Henry III, that at his Marriage-Feaſt he had thirty thouſand Diſhes of Meat; and that King Richard II, ſpent dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a Chriſtmas 26 Oxen, and 300 Sheep, beſides Fowl, and all other Proviſion propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably. Anciently, ſays <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> at a Call of Sergeants at Law, each Sergeant ſpent 1600 Crowns in Feaſting, which in thoſe Days was more than 1600 Pounds now.</p>
                     <p>But the Civil Wars aforeſaid are not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thing which has brought the Engliſh to this Moderation of eating but one Meal a Day. The frequent Uſe of Tobacco, Tea, and Coffee, has had alſo a great hand in it. And the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of making but ſlight Suppers, or rather of turning Suppers into Beverages, has proved ſo conducive to Health, that few People in England make a ſet Supper. Whereas, beyond Sea, 'tis counted the principal Meal.</p>
                     <p>The Plainneſs of the Engliſh Diet is alſo very obſervable in point of Health. Their uſual Way is downright Boiled and Roaſted, without any Sophiſtication; and 'tis certainly the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ones Health. The French Kickſhaws are meer Kitchin Sophiſtry, invented more topleaſe a curious Palate, than to ſatisfy a natural Appetite.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49236:219"/>Their Cooks meer Legerdemains. You take one thing for another, the proper Taſte of the Meat is gone, and another by the virtue of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus Pocus</hi> is ſubſtituted: Thus the Palate is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and the Stomack cheated. 'Tis true, the dainty Frenchified Palates in England love this kind of Tranſmigration; but thoſe who are for Variety, may find here pretty Knacks enough, without running to France for it. For Paſtry no Nation excels the Engliſh, but in Veniſon-Paſties they excel all Nations.</p>
                     <p>But if we go from the Kitchin to the Butte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, here indeed the Engliſh Butler does outdo the French Cook in point of Variety. Beſides the Diverſity of Wines from abroad, from the Eaſt and from the South, here we find Beer and Ale, ſmall and ſtrong of both ſorts; and of the laſt twenty Species, all noted for ſome peculiar quality, moſt for their ſtrength. Nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter than this to the Eye, or to the Palate, when skill and age has brought it to perfection; but nothing more treacherous. It goes down gently and palatably; but, as if it were too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Liquor for thoſe lower Parts, it preſently flyes up to the Head, and puts all there in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. So quick is the Operation of thoſe ſtrong ſorts of Liquors, upon too large a Doſe, that they run a Man out of his Senſes, before he can have an Interval of Mirth. I ſpeak of Men that are not ſo well uſed to thoſe ſorts of Liquors as the North Country Men are, who know beſt how to deal with them.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides the Variety of Wines from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, of Beer and Ale brewed at home, here is drunk abundance of Sider, Perry, Mead, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin, Mum, and ſince the Plague, French Brandy, and Iriſh Uſquebach: two dangerous ſorts of Drink, when taken immoderately. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49236:219"/>I wiſh I could ſay the Engliſh are as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in point of Drinking, as they are in their Eating. But, ſince <hi>Scaliger's</hi> Time, they have in a great meaſure clubbed with the Germans, their old Kinred, in the Character he gives of theſe in one of his Epigrams.</p>

                     <p>The Uſe of Coffee and Tea, two ſober Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours now ſo prevalent in England, do's take off people conſiderably from drinking of ſtrong Liquours. And, were it but for that, the Coffee-houſes ought to be kept up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
                     <p>Now Coffee is made with the berries of a Tree that grows in the Levant, and Tea with the leaves of an India Plant; both hot and dry, and therefore very proper for Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick people. And, whereas ſtrong Liquours
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49236:220"/>are apt to diſorder the Brain, theſe on the contrary do ſettle and compoſe it. Which makes it ſo much uſed by Men of Learning and Buſineſs, who know beſt the virtue of 'em.</p>
                     <p>As for Tobacco, the Uſe whereof is indeed more univerſal, 'tis a Remedy for phlegmatick people, and conſequently not amiſs in this Country. Tis a Companion in Solitude, an Amuſement in Company, an innocent Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Melancholy, and a Help to Fancy in private Studies and Meditations.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the Engliſh Wearing <hi>Apparel,</hi> wherein this Nation has ſhewed in former Ages much Pride and Levity. So fooliſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant they were, ſo ſuperfluous and obſcene, that divers Statutes were made againſt that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, even before the Reformation. Then an Engliſh-man was wont to be pictured naked, with a pair of Sheers in his hand, a piece of Cloth under his Arm, and Verſes annext, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that he knew not what faſhion of Cloaths to have. In Q. Elizabeths Time, ſometimes they took up the German, and ſometimes the Spaniſh Mode. But the French Faſhion has prevailed for the moſt part ſince. Only there was a Time in King Charles the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Reign, that is, about 23 Years ſince, when Men took up a grave ſort of Habit, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like that of the Oriental Nations. But it was ſoon laid aſide, and the French Mode taken up again, which has continued ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>Cloth, amongſt Men, is the general and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only Wear. And that with ſo much plainneſs and comelineſs, with ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and ſo little prodigality, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49236:220"/>formerly ſo apiſh in imitating forein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their Garb, might go now for a Model. The Women indeed, who value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt upon a fine outward Appearance, cannot keep within thoſe Bounds. Whether it be to make a Figure in the World, or out of Emulation amongſt themſelves, or out of Deſign upon Men, they go ſtill in rich Silks, with all the Set-offs that Art can poſſibly invent from time to time. They know that Love do's love Toys, and that Men love to be caught in a fine Net. And herein the Citizens Wives, and Maid-Servants, do run into ſuch Exceſs as makes a Confuſion. So hard it is ſometimes to know a Tradeſmans Wife from a Lady, or the Maid from the Miſtris.</p>
                     <p>As for the Engliſh <hi>Exerciſes</hi> and <hi>Recreations,</hi> ſome they have common with other Nations, as Hunting, Hawking, Fowling, Fiſhing, Tennis, Bowling, Shooting at Bow and Arrows, Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wreſtling, Dancing, Muſick, Stage-Plays, Operas, Maſcarades, Balls, Ballets, &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which their Way of Bowling in fine Greens, contrived and kept for that purpoſe, is beyond any Thing that forein Countries do afford. Wreſtling is an Exerciſe, wherein they have a peculiar Skill, but chiefly the North and Weſtern People. Their Muſick, like their Temper, inclines to gravity. And, if France outdo's the Engliſh in Comedies, England may be ſaid to outdo all Europe in Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides thoſe Exerciſes and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſual with other Nations, they have ſome more peculiar to themſelves; ſuch as Paddock-Courſes, Horſe-races, Cock-fighting, Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, Prizes, Cudgels,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49236:221"/>Foot-ball, Throwing at Cocks, and their Way of Ringing of Bells. Amongſt which the Races ſhew the Swiftneſs of Engliſh Horſes brought up for that purpoſe, which to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners unacquainted with it go's almoſt for a Romance. Cock-fighting ſhews the Courage of their Cocks; Bear-baiting, and Bull-baiting that of their Dogs; and Prizes, the dexterity of ſome Men in handling of Weapons, tho' with ſome effuſion of Bloud. Foot ball is a rude Diverſion for the common ſort of People in froſty Weather. Throwing at Cocks is not only rude, but cruel. And, as to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Way of Ringing the Bells in England, the frequency of it makes it rather a Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ringers than others.</p>
                     <p>The Publick Days for Feaſting, amongſt the Engliſh, are firſt the Holy Daies at Chriſtmas, Eaſter, and Whitſuntide, but chiefly Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Holy-Days: When 'tis uſual for Landlords to treat their Tenants, for Relations and Friends to invite each other, and paſs the Time in Merriments. And, though thoſe Holy-Days are not kept of late Years with that Profuſeneſs as formerly they were; yet I could wiſh they were kept with more devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leſs intemporateneſs.</p>
                     <p>From All-Saints Day to Candlemas, 'tis uſual for each Inn of Court to have Revels on Holy-Days, that is, Muſick and Dancing; and for this they chuſe ſome young Student to be Maſter of the Revels. Before Chriſtmas, the Students, who are for the moſt part Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality that come hither only to learn ſo much Law as may ſerve their turn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Eſtates, meet together in order to keep a ſolemn Chriſtmas. At this Meeting, which they call a Parliament, Officers are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49236:221"/>choſen from among them to bear Rule in the Houſe during the whole Chriſtmas; as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptroller, Treaſurer, &amp;c. Sometimes, when their publick Treaſury can reach it, they make a Prince among themſelves, who keeps a Court accordingly. By whom many of the chief Nobility and great Officers of State are feaſted, and intertained with Interludes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But, whether a Prince or no, the whole Chriſtmas-time (except Sundays) is devoted here to Feaſting, Muſick, Dancing, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ing. This laſt, being allowed to all Comers, is ſo exceſſive, that the Box-mony do's uſually amount to about 50 <abbr>l.</abbr> each 24 hours. Which Mony go's a great way towards the defraying the Charges of the whole Chriſtmas, the reſt being made up by a Contribution from each Student.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides Chriſtmas Holy-Days (which may be called the Carnaval of England) there are other Days of publick Rejoycing. As, the King and Queens Birth and Coronation-Days; the preſent Kings Birth-Day being the 4th of November, the Queens the 30th of April, and their Coronation Day April the 11th.</p>
                     <p>The 5th of November, being Gun-powder Treaſon Day, when the Popiſh Conſpirators had prepared all Things to blow up King James I. and his Parliament then ſitting, is a Day of Thankſgiving, ſolemnly kept to the eternal Confuſion of Popery. This is the Day, when the Pope, by way of Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, uſed ſolemnly to be burnt in Effigie at Temple-Bar in King Charles the Seconds Time, with ſo much State and Pomp, that the Undertakers ſpared for nothing to have it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49236:222"/>done ſutable to the Subject. But, this being diſcontinued, ſince the late King came to the Crown, and being lookt upon beſides by ſober people as a Piece of Exorbitancy, I have done with it, and hope it won't be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Mayors Day, being the 29th of October, is alſo a ſolemn Day of publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and Feaſting for the City of London. Societies have likewiſe their Feaſting Days, when they meet in a Body, either upon the Election of a new Officer, or on ſome other account. But, of all the Societies, there is none to be compared in this point to the Inns of Court, for ſtate and magnificence.</p>
                     <p>As to private Families, 'tis uſual with many to celebrate their Birth and Marriage-Days with their moſt intimate Friends.</p>
                     <p>To improve Society, the life of Recreation, the Engliſh have, beſides their uſual and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings called <hi>Clubs,</hi> the Conveniency of <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> more common here than any where elſe. In theſe all Comers intermix together, with mutual freedom; and, at the ſmall Charge of a peny or two pence of ſuch Liquours as are ſold there, Men have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of meeting together, and getting Acquaintance, with choice of Converſation, and the advantage of reading all forein and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick News.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Bartholomew</hi>'s (vulgarly called <hi>Bartelmy</hi>) Fair is a particular Time for Diverſion to the City of London. It begins on S. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew's Day the 24th of Auguſt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues 14 Days in Weſt-Smithfield; at the end whereof it removes for ſo many Days more to Southwark, on the other ſide of the River. Then is the dead Time of the Year, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49236:222"/>amongſt Citizens is the moſt proper for their Diverſion. This Fair is famous, not ſo much for Things bought or ſold, as for its great Variety of Shews, either of Nature or Art. So that one may apply to it what the Romans of old uſed to ſay of Africk, <hi>Quid novi fert Africa?</hi> For here is always to be ſeen ſtrange ſorts of living Creatures. And for ſuch as love Feats of Activity, Comical, or Tragical Shews, here they are to be ſeen in the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection. Which draws daily during the Fair a great Concourſe of people, to the benefit of the Shewers and the ſatisfaction of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
                     <p>And now, amongſt the Engliſh particular <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> I ſhall in the firſt place take notice of their Way of Pledging one another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is the Original. When the Danes Lorded it over England, they uſed, when the Engliſh drank, to ſtab them, or cut their Throats. To avoid which Villany, the Party then drinking requeſted ſome of the next to him to be his Surety or Pledge, for his Life. From whence came the Expreſſion uſed to this day of Pledging one another, when the Party drunk to takes his turn, and drinks next after him.</p>
                     <p>Another Cuſtom the Engliſh had formerly upon the Danes account; which Time has ſo corrupted, that there remains no ſign of the firſt Inſtitution, except in the Name <hi>Hock-tide,</hi> an old Saxon Word, which ſignify's the Time of Scorning, or Triumphing. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, in the Reign of King Ethelred, were ſo oppreſſed and broken by the Danes, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelred was fain to buy his Peace of them at the yearly Tribute of 10000 pound, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49236:223"/>inhaunced to 48000, which Monies were raiſed upon the Subjects by the Name of <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelt.</hi> But the King, weary of this Exaction, plotted with his Subjects to kill all the Danes, as they ſlept in their Beds. Which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done on <hi>S. Brice</hi>'s Night, <hi>Nov.</hi> 12.1012. The joyfull Engliſh, having thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Country of the Danes, inſtituted the annual Sports of <hi>Hock tide;</hi> in Imitation of the Romans <hi>Fugalia,</hi> at the expulſion of their Kings. This Solemnity conſiſted in the merry Meerings of the Neighbours in thoſe Days during which the Feſtival laſted, and was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the younger ſort of both Sexes, with all manner of Exerciſes and Paſtimes in the Streets. At Coventry they yearly acted a Play called <hi>Hock-Tueſday,</hi> till Q. Elizabeths Time.</p>
                     <p>The 14th of February, being <hi>S. Valentines</hi> Day, has been kept Time out of mind, (and is ſo to this day) both by the Engliſh and Scots, with ſome relation to the Inſtinct of Animals. For Nature teaches us, that about this time of the Year the Beaſts of the Field and Fowls of the Air feeling a new heat by the approach of the Sun, the Males chuſe their Females, and begin to couple. From whence it is probable young Men and Maidens took occaſion to meet together at this time to an equal Number; and, having their reſpective Names writ down ſeverally upon pieces of paper rolled up, the Men draw the Maidens Names, and theſe the Mens. So the Lot gives every Man a She Valentine, and every Maid a He one; the Men wearing their Lots for ſome Days rolled up about their Hat-bands, and the Women before their Breaſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they make each other a Preſent, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49236:223"/>ſometimes it comes to be a Match in good earneſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Particulars, ſo well known to the whole Nation, I would not have inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for the ſatisfaction of Foreiners. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Account I ſhall likewiſe explain, but in few Words, the Story of the Welſh Cuſtom of wearing Leeks on their Hats the firſt day of March, being S. David's Day. Once upon a time (to uſe the old Engliſh Style) the Welſh Liberty lay grievouſly at ſtake; and they muſt either be victorious, or loſe it. In that Extremity they called for help upon S. David, their Patron. Armed with Confidence in that Saint, they croſſed Fields ſowed with Leeks, before they came to ingage; and, for diſtinction ſake, each Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier took up a Leek. The Welſh got the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and, to perpetuate the Memory thereof, as well as out of reſpect to the Saint, they made a Law amongſt themſelves, that on S. David's Day every Man ſhould wear a Leek about his Head. Which is religiouſly by them obſerved every Year; the common people wearing but Garden Leeks, and the better ſort wrought ones. The King himſelf, out of Complacency to that People, wears one upon that Day.</p>
                     <p>The Scots, on their fide, wear a blue Croſs on the fore-part of their Hats upon S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew's Day, their Patron. And the Iriſh a red Croſs on one ſide of their Hats, to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their old Patron, S. Patrick.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEſides the Conveniency of <hi>Travelling</hi> by Water, either by Sea, or here and there upon Rivers, I may ſay the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the beſt provided of any for Land-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, as to Horſes and Coaches. And the Truth is, there is not perhaps a Country ſo proper for't, 'tis generally ſo open and level.</p>
                     <p>Travelling on Horſeback is ſo common a Thing in England, that the meaneſt ſort of People uſe it as well as the reſt. Which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fills the Roads with Riders, not without frequent Diſputes about giving the way, which is unuſual beyond Sea. And, as Engliſh Horſes are the beſt for Expedition, ſo 'tis rare upon the Road to ſee an Engliſhman but upon the Gallop.</p>
                     <p>But for Perſons that are tender, or diſabled, England excels all other Nations in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Coaches, but eſpecially in that of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49236:224"/>Stage-Coaches; a very commodious and eaſy Way of Travelling. Here one may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without over-violent Motion, and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the Injuries of the Air, to moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Places in England. With ſo much ſpeed, that ſome of theſe Coaches will reach above 50 Miles in a Summer Day; and at ſo eaſy Rates, that it is in ſome Places leſs than a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for every Five Miles.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Poſt,</hi> for Intercourſe of Letters, there is a general Office in the City of London, from whence Letters and Pacquets are diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Parts, and the Returns according to their reſpective Directions.</p>
                     <p>This Office, now in Lombard-ſtreet London, is managed in chief by the Poſt-maſter General, who is conſtituted thereto by the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents under the Great Seal of England, whoſe Place is counted to be worth 2000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year. Under him he has a Deputy, and other Officers to a great Number, who give their actual attendance reſpectively in the Diſpatch of Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Upon this General Poſt-Office depends 182 Deputy Poſt-Maſters in England and Scotland; moſt of which keep regular Offices in their Stages, and Sub-Poſt Maſters in their Branches. So that there is no conſiderable Market-Town but has an eaſy and certain. Conveyance for Letters to and from the ſaid Poſt Office in the due Courſe of the Mails every Poſt.</p>
                     <p>There are Weekly three general Poſt Days to ſend from London to any Part of <hi>England, Wales, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> viz. Tueſday, Thurſday, and Saturday. The Returns certain upon Mundays, Wedneſdays, or Fridays; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                        <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence the Return is not ſo certain, by reaſon of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Kent</hi> and the <hi>Downs,</hi> the Poſt goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from London every Day of the Week, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Sundays.</p>
                     <p>The Poſt Days fix'd for <hi>France, Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> are Mundays and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>

                     <p>By what is ſaid, it may eaſily be gueſſed in general, that the Charge of the Poſt-Office is infinitely great. But the Return of it to the King does ſo much over-ballance it, that this Office yields to his Majeſty yearly about Fifty thouſand pounds, all Charges born.</p>
                     <p>Another Uſe of this excellent Conveniency is in relation to Travellers, whoſe Buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires expedition. To which purpoſe there are always Poſt-horſes in readineſs in every Poſt-Stage, which is the main Profit of the Deputy Poſt-Maſters. The Pay is 3 pence for every Engliſh Mile, beſides the Allowance to the Poſt-Boy for Conducting.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Peny-Poſt,</hi> which is uſed only for London and its Neighbourhood, I have already ſpoke of it in my Deſcription of London. And ſo I proceed to the Coyns.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Master and Worker</hi> receives the Bullion, (that is, the Gold and Silver to be coyned) from the Warden, cauſes it to be melted, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it to the Moneyers, and when it is Minted, receives it again from them.</p>

                     <p>But, beſides the foreſaid Officers, there is the Provoſt of the Company of Moneyers, the King's chief Clerk, and four other Clerks for the Receipt Office, the Melters and Smiths, the Blanchers, Moulders, Labourers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> ought to be by Magna Charta, the ſame all over England, that is, according to the King's Standard kept in the Exchequer by the Clerk (or Comptroller) of the Market.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Weights</hi> now uſed throughout all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are of two ſorts, the one called <hi>Troy-Weight,</hi> and the other <hi>Avoir du pois;</hi> the firſt containing 12 Ounces, and the other 16 in the Pound. But then the Ounce <hi>Avoir du pois</hi> is lighter than the <hi>Ounce Troy</hi> by almoſt a 12th part. For, whereas in <hi>Troy-Weight</hi> the Ounce conſiſts of 480 Grains, the Ounce <hi>Avoir du pois</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but 438 Grains.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Troy-Weight</hi> are weighed Pearls, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious-Stones, Gold, Silver, Bread, all manner of Corn and Grain; and this Weight the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries do or ought to uſe. By <hi>Avoir du pois</hi> are weighed all Grocery Ware, Fleſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Iron, Hemp, Flax, Tallow, Wax, Lead,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49236:227"/>Steel, and all things whereof comes Waſte. In conſideration whereof 112 Pound <hi>Avoir du pois</hi> goes to a Hundred-Weight, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably 56 pound to half a Hundred, and 28 to a Quarter, or Tod. A Stone amongſt Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Butchers makes 8 pounds of this Weight, but in the Country 'tis for the moſt part 14.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Troy-Weight</hi> 20 Grains make a Scruple, thus marked ℈, 3 Scruples a Drachm <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, 8 Drachms an Ounce ℥, and 12 Ounces a Pound <abbr>lb.</abbr> In <hi>Avoir du pois Weight,</hi> 16 Drachms make an Ounce, 16 Ounces a Pound, 28 Pound a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 4 Quarters a Hundred, and 20 Hundred a Tun.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Troy Weight,</hi> 24 Grains of Wheat make a Peny-Weight Sterling, 20 Peny-Weights an Ounce, and 12 Ounces a Pound. And, when Wheat is at 5 Shillings the Buſhel, the Peny Wheaten Loaf is then by Statute to weigh 11 Ounces Troy, and three half Peny White Loaves to weigh as much. But the Houſhold Peny-Loaf is to weigh 14 Troy Ounces, and two thirds.</p>
                     <p>As for the Weight called <hi>Venice-Ounce</hi> uſed here, as in other Countries by Silk-men, there is no Standard of it, nor is it allowed by Law. This Ounce being but 13 Peny Weight and 12 Grains, it falls out that 12 Ounces <hi>Venice</hi> is but 8 Ounces 4 peny <hi>Troy,</hi> and 9 Ounces <hi>Avoir du pois.</hi>

                     <p>Now an <hi>Acre</hi> of Land in England conſiſts of 40 Perches in length, and 4 in breadth; a <hi>Yard-Land,</hi> commonly of 30 Acres; and an <hi>Hide</hi> of Land of 100 Acres.</p>
                     <p>The Receptive <hi>Meaſure</hi> is two-fold, that is, either for liquid, or dry Things.

Two Firkins of either ſort make a <hi>Kilderkin,</hi> and 2 Kilderkins a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</hi> But ſtill the Difference in the Number of <hi>Gallons</hi> as to Beer and Ale ought to be minded and allowed. For, as a Kilderkin of Beer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 18 Gallons, and one of Ale but 16; ſo a Barrel of Beer being double a Kilderkin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 36 Gallons, and one of Ale but 32.</p>
                     <p>Now a Barrel and a half of Beer (being 54 Gallons) make a <hi>Hogſhead,</hi> 2 Hogſhheads a <hi>Pipe</hi> or <hi>Butt,</hi> and 2 Pipes a <hi>Tun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note, that a Barrel of Butter or Soap is the ſame with a Barrel of Ale.</p>
                     <p>As for Wine-Meaſures, they fall ſo much ſhort of thoſe of Ale and Beer, that Four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49236:228"/>of theſe make Five Gallous of Wine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Thus they hold proportion as four to five. Of theſe Gallons a <hi>Rundlet</hi> of Wine holds 18, <hi>half a Hogſhead</hi> 31 and a half, a <hi>Tierce</hi> 42, a <hi>Hogſhead</hi> 63, a <hi>Punchion</hi> 84, a <hi>Pipe</hi> or <hi>Butt</hi> 126, a <hi>Tun</hi> 252.</p>
                     <p>For dry Things, ſuch as Corn or Grain, there is firſt the <hi>Gallon,</hi> of a fize between the Wine and the Beer Gallon. Two of theſe Gallons make a <hi>Peck,</hi> 4 Pecks a <hi>Buſhel,</hi> 4 Buſhels a <hi>Comb</hi> or <hi>Curnock,</hi> 2 Curnocks a <hi>Quarter,</hi> 10 Quarters a <hi>Laſt</hi> or <hi>Wey.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt being the <hi>Company of Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,</hi> is the moſt ancient of all, having had their Original in the Reign of Edward I, and their Continuance ever ſince.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49236:229"/>is managed in England by a Governour, Deputy, and certain Aſſiſtants; beyond Sea, by a Deputy, and certain Aſſiſtants.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ruſſia Company</hi> had their Beginning in the Reign of Edward VI, upon the Diſcovery made by the Engliſh of the North-Eaſt Paſſage to Archangel, whereby they opened a great Trade in the Dominions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which Trade and Stock they have built a great Number of War-like Ships, and brought hither thoſe Indian Commodities which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were brought to us by the Portugueze, being the firſt Diſcoverers of the Eaſt-India Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>So that by the Eaſt-India and the Levant Companies, England, and many other Countries by their ſecond Tranſportation, have ever ſince been ſupplied with thoſe Rich Merchandizes which <hi>Italy, Turky, Arabia, Perſia, India,</hi> and <hi>China</hi> yield; where they have their reſpective Agents. On the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel</hi> is the <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> belonging to the Eaſt-India Company, where they have a Preſident of all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49236:229"/>the Factories on that Coaſt, and of the Bay of <hi>Bengala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Royal African Company,</hi> King Charles II was pleaſed by his Letters Patents, to grant them a Liberty of Trading all along the Weſtern Coaſts of Africk, from Cape Vert as far as the Cape of good Hope, with prohibition of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there to all his other Subjects. At <hi>Cape-Coaſt</hi> is the Reſidence of the chief Agent of the Company, where they have a ſtrong Place or Fort.</p>
                     <p>I paſs by the other Companies, though ſome of them very conſiderable; and the great Trade of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> generally managed by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants not Incorporated. Only I ſhall add, that every Company has the Priviledge to govern themſelves by ſetled Acts and Orders, under ſuch Governours, Deputies, Aſſiſtants, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents as they think fit to chuſe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this way has been found to be ſo profitable and beneficial, by Exporting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commodities thereof, by ſetting the Poor on Work, by building of many brave Ships, and by Importing hither of forein Commodities both for Uſe and Ornament, that the Benefit accruing thereby to theſe Nations cannot be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The principal Commodities exported from hence into forein Countries are Woollen Cloths of all ſorts, broad and narrow, the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now the beſt Cloth-Workers in the World. To which add <hi>Sattins, Tabies, Velvets, Pluſhes,</hi> and infinite other <hi>Manufactures;</hi> ſome of which make very good Returns from the foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>Abundance of <hi>Tin, Lead, Alum, Copper, Iron, Fullers Earth, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Coal,</hi> of moſt ſorts of <hi>Grains,</hi> but <hi>Wheat</hi> eſpecially, of <hi>Skins</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49236:230"/>
                        <hi>Leather,</hi> of <hi>Trane Oyl</hi> and <hi>Tallow, Hops</hi> and <hi>Beer, Saffron</hi> and <hi>Licoriſh,</hi> beſides great Plenty of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh,</hi> is yearly tranſported over Sea to forein Conntries.</p>
                     <p>From whence the Merchants make good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, and bring a great deal of Treaſure and rich Commodities, to the Inriching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the unſpeakable benefit of the Nation, and the Credit of the Engliſh in general. Who are as induſtrious and active, as fair Dealers, and great Undertakers as any Nation in the World.</p>
                     <p>For, though the Hollanders perhaps do drive a greater Trade, 'tis neither for want of Stock, nor for want of Induſtry, on the ſide of the Engliſh. The Hollanders, being ſqueezed as they are within the narrow Bounds of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, find little or no Land to purchaſe, with the Returns of their Trade. This puts 'em upon a kind of Neceſſity of improving ſtill their Stock, and of ſending back thoſe Riches a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sea which they cannot fix on the Land. Whereas our Engliſh Merchants having the Opportunity of Injoying the Fruits of their Induſtry, in a ſpacious, delicate, fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by purchaſing Eſtates for themſelves and Families, are apt to yield to the Temptation, and to exchange the hurry of Trade for the pleaſures of a Country-life.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Engliſh Laws, and Religion.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Laws of England are of ſeveral Sorts, and ſeverally uſed according to the Subject.</p>
                     <p>Firſt there is the <hi>Common Law,</hi> that is, the Common Cuſtoms of the Nation, which have by length of time obtained the force of Laws. This is the Summary of the Laws of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Danes, firſt reduced into one Body by King Edward the Elder, about the Year 900. Which, for ſome time being loſt, were revived by King Edward the Confeſſor, and by Poſterity named his Laws. To theſe William the Conquerour having added ſome of the good Cuſtoms of Normandy, he cauſed them all to be written in his own Norman Dialect; which, being no where vulgarly uſed, varies no more than the Latine. Therefore to this day all Reports, Pleadings, and Law-Exerciſes, Declarations upon Original Writs, and all Records are written in the old Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>But where the Common Law falls ſhort, the <hi>Statute Law</hi> makes it up. Which are the Laws made from time to time by King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Civil Law,</hi> which is counted the Law of Nations, is peculiarly made uſe of in all Eccleſiaſtical Courts, in the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49236:231"/>in That of the Earl Marſhal, in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with forein Princes, and laſtly in the Two Univerſities of the Land.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> otherwiſe called the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws, takes place in Things that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to Religion. This Law comprehends the Canons of many ancient General Councils, of many National and Provincial Engliſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, divers Decrees of the Biſhops of Rome, and Judgments of ancient Fathers, received by the Church of England, and incorporated into the Body of the Canon Law. By which ſhe did ever proceed in the Exerciſe of her Juriſdiction, and do's ſtill by virtue of an Act in the Reign of Henry VIII, ſo far as the ſaid Canons and Conſtitutions are not repugnant to the Holy Scripture, to the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or the Laws of this Realm. But, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Temporal Laws inflict Puniſhment upon the Body, theſe properly concern the Soul of Man. And, as they differ in ſeveral Ends, ſo they differ in ſeveral Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Martial Law</hi> reaches none but Souldiers and Mariners, and is not to be uſed but in time of actual War. But the late King, who ran headlong to Arbitrary Power, made nothing of violating this, and moſt other Laws.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Foreſt-Law</hi> concerns the Foreſts, and in flicts Puniſhment on thoſe that treſpaſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. By virtue of this Law, the Will is reputed for the Fact; ſo that, if a Man be taken hunting a Deer, he may be Arreſted as if he had taken it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there are <hi>Municipal Laws,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Peculiar</hi> (or <hi>By</hi>) <hi>Laws,</hi> proper to Corporations. Theſe are the Laws which the Magiſtrates of a Town or City, by virtue of the King's Charter, have a Power to make for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49236:231"/>the benefit and advantage of their Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Provided always, that the ſame be not repugnant to the Laws of the Land. Theſe By-Laws properly bind none but the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Place, unleſs they be for publick Good, or to avoid a publick Inconvenience. In which Caſe they bind Strangers.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in general as to the Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The chief Particulars will come in of courſe, when I come to treat of the Government.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Religion</hi> of England, as it is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, is the beſt Reformed Religion, and the moſt agreeable to the primitive Times of Chriſtianity. But, before I come to ſhew the Occaſion, Time, and Methods of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, it will not be improper to give a brief hiſtorical Account how the Chriſtian Faith came to be planted in this Iſland, to ſet forth its Progreſs, Decay, and Reſtauration; then its Corruption with Rome, and at laſt its Reformation.</p>
                     <p>That Chriſtianity was planted here in the Apoſtles Times, long before King <hi>Lucius,</hi> is plainly demonſtrated by the <hi>Antiquity of the Britiſh Churches,</hi> writ ſome Years ſince by <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> the preſent Biſhop of Worceſter. Where he learnedly diſproves the Tradition concerning <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> (ſuppoſed by many to have been the firſt Planter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel here) as an Invention of the Monks of <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> to ſerve their Intereſts, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Reputation of their Monaſtery; and makes it highly probable, that S. Paul (rather than S. Peter, as others would have it) was the firſt Founder of a Church in this Iſland. But, by reaſon of Perſecutions, or for want of a ſupply of Preachers, Chriſtianity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49236:232"/>did not flouriſh here till the Reign of <hi>Lucius</hi> the Britiſh King, and the firſt Chriſtian King in Europe. Of whoſe imbracing Chriſtianity the learned Biſhop gives this Account from the Teſtimony of ancient Writers, that the was firſt inclined thereto by the Perſuaſion of <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Eduinus,</hi> two Britiſh Chriſtians, who were probably imploy'd to convince him. But, being workt upon on the other ſide by his <hi>Druids,</hi> he would not come to any Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he had ſent to Rome for his further Satisfaction, and to know how far the Britiſh Chriſtians and thoſe of Rome agreed. <hi>Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus</hi> was then Biſhop of Rome, and the twelfth from the Apoſtles. To whom he ſent the foreſaid <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus</hi> about the Year 180, preſuming (as he might reaſonably then) that the Chriſtian Doctrine was there truly taught, at ſo little diſtance from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and in a Place whither a Reſort was made from all Parts, becauſe of its being the Imperial City. For there was then no Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of S. Peter's having appointed the Head of the Church there, nor a long time after in the Britiſh Churches, as appears by the Conteſt of the Britiſh Biſhops with Auguſtine the Monk.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Lucius,</hi> being ſatisfied upon the Return of his Embaſſadors from Rome, imbraced the Chriſtian Faith, and received the Baptiſm. So that by the piety of his Example, and the diligence of the firſt Preachers, Chriſtianity ſoon ſpread over his Dominions, and ſometime after over all the Iſland. And then the <hi>Britains</hi> had Biſhops of their own, without any Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Dependency from the See of Rome, the Britiſh Church continuing a diſtinct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Church from all others.</p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49236:232"/>
                     <p>But, when the Heathen <hi>Saxons</hi> came to be poſſeſſed of this Part of the Iſland, and the Natives forced to take ſhelter amongſt the Mountains of Wales, the Chriſtian Faith fled with them, and this Country was again dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Heatheniſm. Till about the Year 596. Auſtin the Monk was ſent by Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Great, to preach the Goſpel here. By whoſe Diligence and Zeal the Work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered ſo well, that all the Saxons were by degrees converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and Auſtin made the firſt Arcſh-biſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, but with a ſubjection to the Church of Rome. Thus, as the Errours crept on in the Roman, the Britiſh Church grew infected with them, and continued ſubject to the Power and Errours of Rome, till King Henry VIII laid the Ground for a Reformation, by his reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of the Chriſtian Britiſh Kings his ancient Predeceſſors, and removing by virtue of it the forfeited Primacy of Rome to the See of Canterbury. But 'tis Obſervable withall, that this Ejection of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was not done (as in other Nations) tumultuouſly, and by the Power of the People, but by the Counſel and Advice of godly and learned Divines aſſembled in Convocation by the King's Authority, and ratified by the Three States in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ancient Dignity and Supremacy of the Kings of England being reſtored, and the Subjects delivered from the Spiritual Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Pope of Rome, the King and Clergy took this Occaſion to inquire into and reform the great Abuſes and Errours crept into the Church. Whoſe Method in this Work (begun in Henry's Reign, and brought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49236:233"/>to perfection in his next Succeſſor's Time) Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſets forth in theſe Words. The Architects, ſays he, in this great Work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect unto the Dictates of Luther or Calvin, looking only on God's Word and the Primitive Patterns, aboliſhed ſuch Things as were repugnant unto either, but ſtill retained ſuch Ceremonies in God's publick Worſhip as were agreeable to both, and had been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the Practice of the Primitive Times. A Point wherein they did obſerve a greater Meaſure of Chriſtian Prudence and Moderation, than their Neighbour Churches, Which in a meer deteſtation of the See of Rome, allowed of nothing which had formerly been in uſe amongſt them, becauſe defiled with Popiſh Errors and Abuſes; utterly avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby thoſe of the Papal Party from joyning with them in the Work, or coming over to them when the Work was done. Whereas, had they continued an allowable Correſpondency in theſe Extrinſecals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with the Church of Rome, their Party in the World had been far greater, and not ſo much ſtomached as it is. And this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his he backs with the Sentiment of the Marqueſs <hi>de Rhoſne</hi> in this point, after Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> and Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>France,</hi> one of the chief Men of the Reformed Party there. Who, being ſent Embaſſador to King James from Henry IV. King of France, admired the Decency of Gods publick Service in the Church of England.</p>
                     <p>Three Things principally are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in point of Religion, viz. The Doctrine, the Manner of publick Worſhip, and the Church Government.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49236:233"/>
                     <p>As for the Doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, 'tis the ſame in all Points with other Reformed Churches, as it appears by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith contained in the 39 Articles. The Manner of publick Worſhip differs in nothing from them, but in the Excellency of it. So many admirable Prayers the Engliſh Liturgy contains, ſutable to all Occaſions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in a plain Evangelical Style, without Rhetorical Raptures, which are fitter for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Orator than an humble Addreſſer to the Mercy-Seat of God. In ſhort, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting in the Church of England, in order to Salvation. She uſes the Word of God, the Ten Commandments, the Faith of the Apoſtles, the Creeds of the Primitive Church, the Articles of the four firſt General Councils, an excellent Liturgy, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, and all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Counſels of the Goſpel. She attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes all Glory to God, worſhips his moſt holy Name, and owns all his Attributes. She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores the Trinity in Unity, the Unity in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. She teaches Faith and Repentance, the Neceſſity of good Works, the ſtrictneſs of a holy Life, and an humble Obedience to the Supreme Power. Charity, which is the grand Mark of the true Church, is ſo eſſential to this, that ſhe do's not ingroſs Heaven to her ſelf, ſo as to damn all others into Hell. For the publick Service and Worſhip of God ſhe has Places, Times, Perſons, and Revenues ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for that purpoſe; and an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops, to ordain Prieſts and Deacons, and do all other Duties iucumbent to that Dignity.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49236:234"/>
                     <p>Happy were it for England, if all its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would live in the Communion of this Church, and not ſeparate from it; which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Thing more to be wiſhed, than hoped for. But ſuch is the deſigning and ambitious Spirit of Popery, to weaken the Church of England (ever ſince the Reformation lookt upon as the chiefeſt Bulwark againſt Popery) that it has cauſed all our Diſtractions, in order to fiſh the better in troubled Waters. Yet whatever have been the Effects of it hitherto, God has wonderfully defeated their Deſigns. Inſomuch that this Church, formerly ſcattered and eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Reign of Charles I, reſtored (but afterwards undermined) by Charles II, and lately threatned with utter Ruin by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succeſſor, is now, by the ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in a Houriſhing Condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the happy Influence of our preſent King William, the Reſtorer of our Laws, Religion, and Liberties.</p>
                     <p>As for the Spirit of Perſecution which the Church of England has been charged with in relation to Diſſenters, it cannot be juſtly laid to her Charge. For whatever has been done in that Caſe was but according to Law, and the Penal Laws were made (as all Statute-Laws) in a regular Manner by the Votes of Parliament, the Repreſentatives of the People, as well Diſſenters as others. 'Tis true, the Church-Party proved the moſt predominant. And yet, in point of Execution, the ſober part of the Church were always very tender, and none but hot Men amongſt them ready for Execution. Influenced thereto by the Court; which, far from deſigning the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Union with the Church, uſed the Rigour of the Law, to create an implacable Hatred
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49236:234"/>betwixt the afflicting Church and the ſuffering Body of the Diſſenters. Which had a ſutable Effect. For theſe, imbittered what with Fines, what with Impriſonments, tho according to Law, failed not to clamour on all ſides againſt the perſecuting Spirit of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and againſt thoſe bloudy Laws, as they uſed to call 'em. The Senſe of their preſent ſtate made them forget what they had done, when they uſurped the Regal Power; and how buſy they were to impriſon, to baniſh, to ſequeſter. With Grief I rake up theſe old Sores, and nothing but a juſt Deſire of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Parties could have extorted this from me.</p>
                     <p>But now the Diſſenters have got Liberty of Conſcience by a late Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church-Party in both Houſes, I hope there's no Ground left for Animoſities between the Church and Them. And, if the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who are the neareſt to the Church of England, and the greateſt Party among Diſſenters, now they have ſeen ſo much of her incomparable Learning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Stedfaſtneſs to the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, would but ſhake off their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Prejudices, and prefer the happineſs of a Reunion before the Danger of a Schiſm, what a Bleſſing it would prove to this Nation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unconceivable. 'Tis not long ſince the Church was their Sanctuary, when they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Mercy from a late King, who came to the Throne, full of Reſentment and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them. Tho afterwards, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his own Ends, he tacked about, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them almoſt with Kindneſs. And why they ſhould now ſeparate from a Church, which was ſo lately their Refuge, when they crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49236:235"/>the very Church-Men out of Church, it is paſt my Underſtanding. For the Church of England is the ſame ſtill. Were they but ſo well-minded as to make the leaſt ſtep towards a Reunion, I am aſſured the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would be very forward to meet them. Rather than they ſhould continue their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and be Accountable to Gods Tribunal for it, I am more than confident ſhe would readily part with ſuch Ceremonies as give 'em moſt offence. But it is feared, they would not be ſatisfied with thoſe ſmall Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They are for more ſubſtantial Things, which for Peace ſake I ſhall forbear to name, and leave for the Reader to gueſs.</p>
                     <p>The main Points wherein they differ from the Church of England is the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the publick Worſhip. They hold, that the Church was governed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Presbyters or Elders, and that it ſhould be ſo governed ſtill, not by Biſhops; upon which account they got the Name of Presbyterians. They except both againſt the latitude of the Biſhops Power, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Revenues, as if neither of them could be uſed by the Clergy with Chriſtian Moderation. But it is more probable, the unſhaken fidelity of Biſhops to Monarchy which many of the Diſſenters were never very fond of, ſticks moſt in their Stomack For publick Worſhip they uſe no Liturgy wherein they differ from the Proteſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Heptarchy continued thus for ſeveral Ages ſeparate and diſtinct, till the prevailing Fortune of the Weſt-Saxons united them all into one, by the Name of <hi>England.</hi> Which hapned Anno 819, in the Reign of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> the laſt King of the Weſt-Saxons, and the firſt of England. Who, having vanquiſhed all the reſt of the Saxon Kings, and added moſt of their Eſtates to his own, cauſed the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Body to be called <hi>Engel-lond,</hi> ſince turned into <hi>England,</hi> in a Parliament (or Council) held at Wincheſter, in the Year aforeſaid. And by that Name he was then crowned in the preſence of his Nobles, and the reſt of his Subjects. Though the Truth is, King <hi>Alfred,</hi> a Grandchild of <hi>Egbert,</hi> was he who total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united the Saxon Heptarchy into one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Thus, from the Time of Egbert to this preſent Time, <hi>England</hi> has continued a Monarchy above 870, Year. Firſt, under 15 Kings of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Bace; then under 3 <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings; and next to them, under Edward the Confeſſour, and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> II, two Kings of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood. Who were ſucceeded by four <hi>Norman</hi> Kings. And after Stephen the laſt of the Four, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood was again reſtored in the Perſon of King Henry II, Anno 1155, in whoſe Blood the Crown has continued ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>Now the Engliſh Monarchy is none of thoſe Deſpotical Monarchies, where the Subjects (like Slaves) are at the Arbitrary Power and Will of their Sovereign. An unnatural ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and directly contrary to the true end of Government, which is the Preſervation, Welfare, and Happineſs of the People. And what Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can a People propoſe to themſelves, when inſtead of being protected, they may be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49236:239"/>and murdered at the will of their Prince? Men had as good live in a ſtate of Anarchy, as ly at ſome Princes Mercy, whoſe unlimited Power ſerves only to make them furious and outragious. And where lies the Advantage, when the King proves a cruel Tyrant, to be Robbed or Murdered by a Royal, or a common Robber?</p>
                     <p>The Government of England, Thanks be to God, is better Conſtituted. 'Tis a Monarchy, but not with that Dominion which a Maſter has over his Slave. For then the King might lawfully ſell all his Subjects, like ſo many Head of Cattel, and make Mony of his whole Stock when he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Here the Legiſlative Power is divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People, but the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power is lodged ſolely in the King. Here the King has his Prerogative, which is the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Crown; and the People their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which aſſert their Liberty. If the King ſtretches his Prerogative ſo far beyond its Bounds, as to overthrow the Liberty of the Subject, he unhinges the Government; and the Government being diſſolved, He and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to ſeek as in the late King's Caſe. If any part of the Subjects incroach upon his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they undergo the laſh of the Law; which is no leſs tender of the Kings Prerogative, than of the Subjects Liberty.</p>
                     <p>But the Queſtion is, in caſe of a Difference betwixt the King and his People, who is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge.</p>
                     <p>To anſwer this Objection, I ſhall make uſe of the <hi>Inquiry into the Meaſures of Submiſſion to the Supream Authority.</hi> 'Tis to be conſidered, ſays the Learned and Judicious Author, that ſome Points are juſtly diſputable and doubtful; and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49236:239"/>others ſo manifeſt, that any Objections made againſt them are rather forced Pretences, than ſo much as plauſible Colours. If the Caſe be doubtful, the Intereſt of the publick Peace and Order ought to carry it. But the Caſe is quite different, when the Invaſions that are made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Liberty and Property, are plain and viſible to all that conſider them.</p>
                     <p>But, upon ſuch an Invaſion, how can the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of England take up Arms againſt their King, when the Militia is by ſeveral expreſs Laws lodged ſingly in the King; and thoſe Laws have been put in the form of an Oath, which all that have born any Imployment either in Church or State have ſworn? So that, though the Subjects have a Right to their Property by many poſitive Laws, yet they ſeem now to have no Right or Means left to preſerve it. And here ſeems to be a Contradiction in the Engliſh Government; <hi>viz.</hi> a publick Liberty challenged by the Nation, and grounded upon Law, and yet a Renouncing of all Reſiſtance, when that Liberty is invaded, and that alſo grounded upon Law.</p>
                     <p>This is indeed the main Difficulty. But, in Anſwer to it, this we muſt take for a general Rule, when there ſeems to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Conſtitution: That we ought to examine which of the two is the moſt evident, and the moſt important, and ſo fix upon it; then we muſt give ſuch an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating ſenſe to that which ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it, that ſo we may reconcile 'em together. 'Tis plain, that our Liberty is only a Thing that we injoy at the Kings Diſcretion and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Pleaſure, if the other againſt all Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to be underſtood according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of the Words. Therefore, ſince the chief Deſign of our whole Law, and of all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49236:240"/>the ſeveral Rules of our Conſtitution, is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a Concluſion, that it is both the moſt plain, and the moſt important of the two. And the other Article againſt Reſiſtance ought to be ſo ſoftened, as that it do not deſtroy us.</p>
                     <p>If the Law never deſigned to lodge the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power in the King, as it is ſelf-evident, 'tis plain it did not intend to ſecure him in it, in caſe he ſhould go about to aſſume it. Therefore the not reſiſting the King can only be applied to the Executive Power, that ſo, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no pretence of ill Adminiſtrations in the Execution of the Law, it ſhould be lawful to reſiſt him. Another Proof that the Law only deſigned to ſecure the King in the Executive Power, is the Words of the Oath, which makes it unlawful to bear Arms againſt the King, or any Commiſſionated by him. For, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be not according to Law, 'tis no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and conſequently thoſe who act by virtue of it, are not Commiſſionated by the King in the ſenſe of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, all general Words, how compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive ſoever, are ſtill ſuppoſed to have a tacit Exception and Reſerve in them, if the matter ſeem to require it. Thus Children are commanded to obey their Parents in <hi>all Things;</hi> and Wives are declared by the Scripture to be ſubject to their Husbands in <hi>all Things, as the Church is unto Chriſt.</hi> For odious Things ought not to be ſuſpected, and therefore not named upon ſuch Occaſions; but when they fall out, they carry ſtill their own force with them. So by our Form of Marriage, the Parties ſwear to one another, <hi>till Death them do part;</hi> and yet few doubt but that this Bond is diſſolved by Adultery, though it is not named.</p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49236:240"/>
                     <p>In ſhort, when a King of England ſtrikes at the very Foundations of the Government, as the late King did, and that his Maleverſations are not only the effect of Humane Frailty, of Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Paſſions, to which all Princes may be ſubject, as well as other Men, in ſuch Caſes that King may fall from his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or at leaſt from the Exerciſe of it, and ſuch his Attempts (in the very Judgement of the greateſt Aſſertors of Monarchy,) naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him of his whole Authority. To this purpoſe we have ſtill freſh before us the Example of the late King of Portugal, who for a few Acts of Rage fatal to very few Perſons, was put under a Guardianſhip, and kept a Priſoner till he died, and his Brother the preſent King made Regent in his place. Which it ſeems was (at leaſt ſecretly) approved by moſt of the Crowned Heads of Europe, and even our Court gave the firſt Countenance to it. Though of all others, King Charles II. had the leaſt Reaſon to do it, ſince it juſtified a Younger Brother's ſupplanting the Elder. But the Evidence of the Thing carried it even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are my Authors Arguments, which I thought fit to inſiſt upon, to juſtify the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taking up Arms for the Defence of their Laws, Religion, and Property, againſt the late King's actual and bare-faced Subverting the whole Frame of this moſt happy and bleſſed Government.</p>
                     <p>A Government which has made many Kings glorious beyond the Great Nimrod of France, and their People happy beyond all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A Government which allows enough to a King that cares not to be a Tyrant, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the People to keep them from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49236:241"/>When the King's Prerogative do's not interfere with the Liberty of the People, or the Peoples Liberty with the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is, when both King and People keep within their own Sphere, there is no better framed Government under the Sun. Here is Monarchy without Slavery; a great King, and yet a free People. And, the Legiſlative-Power being lodged in the King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons joyntly, 'tis ſuch a Monarchy as has the main Advantages of an Ariſtocracy in the Lords, and of a Democracy in the Commons, without the Diſadvantages or Evils of either.</p>
                     <p>The Government of England being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitued, I ſee no Ground there is for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, where the Kings Commands are viſibly contrary to Law, and deſtructive of the Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſures of Power, and conſequently of Obedience, muſt be taken from the expreſs Laws of the State, or from Immemorial Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, or from particular Oaths which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſwear to their Princes. And, in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes between Power and Liberty, Power muſt always be proved, for Liberty proves it ſelf; that being founded only upon a Poſitive Law, this upon the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now 'tis plain, the Law of Nature has put no Difference (or Subordination) amongſt Men, except it be that of Children to their Parents, or of Wives to their Husbands. So that, with relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born Free; and this Liberty muſt be ſtill ſuppoſed intire, unleſs ſo far as it is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Contracts, Proviſions, and Laws.</p>
                     <p>And, as a private Perſon can bind himſelf to another Man by different Degrees, either as a common Servant for Wages, or as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49236:241"/>appropriate for a longer Time, or as a Slave by a total giving himſelf up to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſo may ſeveral Bodies of Men give themſelves upon different Terms and Degrees to the Conduct of others. And, as in thoſe Caſes the general Name of <hi>Maſter</hi> may be equally uſed, tho the degrees of his Power are to be judged by the nature of the Contract; ſo in theſe all may carry the ſame Name of <hi>King,</hi> and yet every ones Power is to be taken from the Meaſures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations founded on ſome equivocal Terms, ſuch as King, Sovereign, or Supream.</p>
                     <p>But this has been of late ſo learnedly argued, that I ſhall wave any further Diſcuſſion of this Matter. This only I ſhall add, that the King of England is, by the moderate Aſſertors of this Monarchy, called <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and <hi>Sponſus Regni.</hi> By which Metaphorical Characters the King and his Subjects come within the Relation of a Father and Children, or within that of a Husband and Wife; which is proper enough to repreſent the Nature and Mildneſs of the Engliſh Government. Others make King and Subject to be no other Relation than that of <hi>Gardian</hi> and <hi>Ward. Ad tutelam namque</hi> (ſays Forteſcue) <hi>Legis Subditorum, ac eorum Corporum &amp; Bonorum, Rex hujuſmodi erectus eſt;</hi> the King being ordained for the Defence or Gardianſhip of the Laws of his Subjects, and of their Bodies and Goods.</p>
                     <p>I have done, and now I proceed to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſcription of this Monarchy. 'Tis Free and Independent, that is, not holden of any Earthly Potentate, or any ways obliged to do Homage for the ſame; as the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> holden of the Pope by the King of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49236:242"/>Spain, and that of <hi>Scotlund</hi> which held <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite</hi> of the Crown of England. Whereas the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> owns no Superiour upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>A Monarchy that juſtly challenges a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all Subjection to the Emperour, or Laws of the Empire. For, tho the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors were anciently poſſeſſed of this Country, and got by force of Arms the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; yet, upon their quitting the ſame, the Right (by the Law of Nations) returned to the former Owners <hi>pro Derelicto,</hi> as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is alſo free from all manner of Subjection to the Pope of Rome, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from thoſe ſeveral Inconveniencies and Burdens which ly upon Popiſh Kingdoms. As Taxes paid to that Biſhop, Proviſions and Diſpenſations in ſeveral Caſes to be procured from the Court of Rome, and Appeals thither in Eccleſiaſtical Suits.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an Hereditary Monarchy, and ſuch as allow's of no <hi>Interregnum;</hi> free therefore from thoſe Miſchiefs and Inconveniencies which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend ſuch Kingdoms as are Elective. Though it is granted, at leaſt it ſeems appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by Hiſtory, that England has been an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Kingdom, eſpecially in the Time of the Saxons; When, upon the King's Death, thoſe Perſons of the Realm that compoſed the then Parliament aſſembled, in order to the chuſing of another. And, tho one or other of the Royal Bloud was always choſen, yet the next in lineal Succeſſion was often ſet aſide, as is evident from the Genealogies of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings. But, however it was in thoſe and after Times, certain it is that ever ſince King Henry VII. the Crown has run in a courſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49236:242"/>of lineal Succeſſion by Right of Inheritance. Till the late King, having forſaken the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and abdicated the Kingdom, the Crown (with the general Conſent of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was ſet upon the Head of the Prince of Orange (our preſent King) joyntly with the Princeſs the next Heir to King James, and the Succeſſion ſettled as will appear afterwards. And upon William and Mary, our Gracious King and Queen, may the Crown long flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, whatever be the Bent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of ſome Men amongſt us for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the Generality of the Nation is ſo much for Monarchy, that it is like ſo to continue as long as the World indures. In that Eclipſe of Monarchy which hapned before the Reſtauration of King Charles II, how buſy then the Commonwealth Party was to provide againſt its Return, and to ſettle here Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for ever, all the World know's. No Stone was left unturned, and what came of it? As ſoon as ever Opportunity ſerved, the very Presbyterians themſelves joyned with the Royaliſts to bring in the exiled King, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the ancient Government. So ſoon the Nation grew ſick of the Commonwealth, and ſo ſtrong was then the Current for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that, without the ſhedding of a drop of Bloud, the firſt was in a manner hiſſed out of the Nation, and Monarchy reſtored with the greateſt Pomp and Joy imaginable.</p>
                     <p>I ſet aſide the Zeal of our Engliſh Clergy for Monarchy, and their Influence upon the Laity. The great Number alone of our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry, with their proportionable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent upon the People, makes me look upon it as a moral Impoſſibility for Commonwealth-Government ever to prevail here. 'Tis well
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49236:243"/>known, the Genius of Commonwealths is for keeping down the Nobility, and extinguiſhing all thoſe Beams of Royalty. Therefore as 'tis their Intereſt, ſo I ſuppoſe it will be their Care, to ſtick to Monarchy.</p>

                     <p>THE King of <hi>England</hi> is otherwiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as being the ſole Sovereign and ſupreme Head of this great and famous Iſland, containing the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Principality of Wales.</p>
                     <p>Which Principality was firſt united, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to the Crown of England Anno 1282, by King Edward I. Who overcame and ſlew in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel <hi>Llewellen,</hi> the laſt Sovereign Prince of Wales, of the Race of <hi>Cadwallader</hi> the laſt King of the Britains. After the Conqueſt thereof, he took all the provident Care imaginable to ſecure it to the Crown; but the Welſh ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelves within the bounds of true Allegiance, till the Reign of Henry VII, who was extracted from the Welſh Bloud. In
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49236:243"/>whoſe Succeſſor's Reign, Henry VIII, they were made by Act of Parliament one Nation with the Engliſh, ſubject to the ſame Laws, capable of the ſame Preferments, priviledged with the ſame Immunities, and inabled to ſend Knights and Burgeſſes to the Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that the Name and Language only excepted, there is now no Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Engliſh and Welſh. A very happy Union.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scotland</hi> was alſo brought into Subjection by the ſame King Edward; ſo that he received Homage of its King and Nobility, and had there his Chancery and other Courts under a Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy. But with much ſtrugling they recovered at laſt their Liberty, and ſet up a King of their own, <hi>Robert Bruce;</hi> who had the luck to be confirmed in it by the Defeat given to Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward II, one of our unfortunate Kings. 'Tis true his Son King Edward III, a moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and valorous Prince, changed the face of Affairs in Scotland, and brought again the Scots to Obedience. Inſomuch that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded David, the Son of <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> from the Crown, then forced to fly into France, and reſtored the Houſe of <hi>Baliol</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the perſon of <hi>Edward</hi> Son of King <hi>John Baliol.</hi> Who, upon his coming to the Crown, did Homage to this King Edward, as his Father had done to King Edward I. But 'twas not long before the Scots quitted again their Subjection and Vaſſalage to the Crown of England, the Roll of <hi>Ragman</hi> being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly delivered into their hands by Roger Mortimer Earl of March. Which Roll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Confeſſion and Acknowledgement of the Eſtates of Scotland, ſubſcribed by all their Hands and Seals; whereby they owned the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49236:244"/>Superiority of the Kings of England, not only in regard of ſuch Advantages as the Sword had given them, but as of their original and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right.</p>
                     <p>But, ſetting aſide this point of Vaſſalage, the Kings of England are Kings of Scotland by a better Title. For King James VI of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the firſt of England, ſucceeded Q. Elizabeth in the Realm of England, as the next Heir to the Crown, Anno 1602; being deſcended, by Mary Queen of the Scots his Mother, from Margaret, the eldeſt Daughter of Henry the VII. King of England, and Wife to James IV, of Scotland. And here the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudent Foreſight of Henry is very remarkable. Who, having two Daughters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Eldeſt (contrary to the Mind of his Council) on the King of Scots, and the younger on the French King; that, if his own Iſſue Male ſhould fail, as it did by the Death of his Grandſon King Edward VI, and that a Prince of another Nation muſt inherit England, then Scotland as the leſſer Kingdom, ſhould depend upon England, and not England wait on France, as upon the greater. In which Succeſſion of the Scots to the Crown of England, the Prophecy of the fatal Stone received ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. I mean the Stone which the Scots lookt upon as their <hi>Palladium,</hi> kept at <hi>Scone</hi> in Scotland, the uſual Place for the Coronation of the Scotiſh Kings; upon which they received their Crown, till the Removal of it unto Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter by King Edward I. The Verſes of old ingraven upon this Stone run thus,
<q>
                           <l>Non fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum,</l>
                           <l>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</l>

                     <p>Tranſlated in old Meeter thus.
<q>
                           <l>The Scots ſhall brook that Realm as natif Ground,</l>
                           <l>If <hi>Weirds</hi> fail not, where ere this Stone is found.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Scots, ſo often quelled and curbed by the Engliſh, never ſubdued England but by this bleſſed Victory.</p>
                     <p>Ever ſince this happy Union, Scotland has been deprived of its Kings Reſidence there, who changed the worſe Seat for the better. But under the King there is a chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour appointed by his Majeſty, the <hi>Lord High Commiſſioner</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> who, by that Title, injoys the ordinary Power and Authority of a Viceroy. In this manner <hi>Scotland</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to this day a ſeparate Kingdom, governed by its own Laws. 'Tis true there have been ſeveral Attempts made to unite it into one Kingdom with England, as <hi>Wales</hi> was by Henry VIII. But hitherto they proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesfull.</p>
                     <p>So far we have cleared in few Words by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory the whole Iſle of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to the King of England; with the numerous Iſlands about it, the principal of which are the Iſles of <hi>Shepey, Thanet, Wight, Angleſey,</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next that offers it ſelf is the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a great Part whereof was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the Engliſh about the Year 1172. in the Reign of Henry II, and the Occaſion thus. Ireland being then divided amongſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>petty Kings, the King of Leinſter was by the King of Meath driven out of his Kindom.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49236:245"/>He fled to England for Refuge; where, applying himſelf to King Henry, Henry reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt his Reſtauration; which he did effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and in the doing of it, brought the beſt part of the Iſland under the Engliſh Subjection. King John, the Younger Son of Henry, was the firſt who was Intituled Lord of Ireland. Which Stile was granted him by Pope Urban III, and continued to his Succeſſors (though in effect Kings thereof) till the Year 1542; when Henry VIII, was declared in an Iriſh Parliament King of Ireland, as a Name more ſacred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with Majeſty. But the Engliſh never made a full and entire Conqueſt of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom till the latter end of Queen Elizabeths Reign, upon the great Defection of the Iriſh. Which ended in a total Overthrow of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, then under the Conduct of <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tiroen;</hi> and the conſequence of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule, That every Rebellion, when 'tis ſuppreſſed, does make the Prince ſtronger, and the Subjects weaker: Which I hope will be the effect of the preſent Rebellion in that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides Great Britain and Ireland, the King of England is poſſeſſed of <hi>Jerſey, Garn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Alderney,</hi> and <hi>Sark,</hi> four Iſlands of good note (eſpecially the two firſt) on the Coaſt of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy in France. The ſame are holden in right of that Dukedom, which was Conquered by Henry I, of England, and continued Engliſh till the Days of King John; when Philip II, of France, ſurnamed Auguſtus, ſeized on all the Eſtates the Engliſh had in France, as Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Anno 1202. And, ſince the French ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon Normandy, they have often attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Garnſey,</hi> but always with repulſe and loſs. So affectionate are the People to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49236:245"/>Engliſh Government, and jealous of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they injoy under it, which they could not hope for from the French.</p>
                     <p>In America the King of England is poſſeſſed of <hi>New-England, Virginia, Mary-Land, New York, Penſylvania, Carolina,</hi> and <hi>Hudſons-Bay.</hi> Beſides many noted Iſlands, as <hi>New-found Land, Jamaica, Bermudos, Barbados;</hi> and, amongſt the Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iſlands, <hi>Nevis, Antego, Montſerat, Anguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In Aſia he has the Iſle of <hi>Bombay</hi> near Goa, which was Part of the preſent Queen Dowagers Portion; beſides Conveniencies for Traffick in India, China, and the Levant. The ſame he has upon the Coaſt of Africk.</p>
                     <p>The King of England has a Claim beſides to the <hi>Sovereignty of all the Seas</hi> round about Great Britain and Ireland, and all the Iſles adjacent, even to the Shores of all the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore all Foreiners Ships have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demanded Leave to Fiſh, and to paſs in theſe Seas; and to this day lower their Top-Sails to all the Kings Ships of War. Our Law faith, the Sea is of the Liegeance of the King, as well as the Land. And accordingly Children born upon our four Seas (as ſometimes it does happen) are accounted natural born Subjects of the King of England, without being naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                     <p>The King of England has moreover a Title to the Kingdom of France. Firſt Challenged by King Edward III, as Son and Heir of Iſabel, the Daughter of King Philip the Fair, and Siſter of Lewis IX, Philip V, and Charles the Fair, who reigned ſucceſſively, and died without Iſſue Male. To proſecute which Title, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to France with an Army, took upon him the Title of King of France, and cauſed the Flower
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49236:246"/>de luces to be quartered with the Lions of England; which has been continued ever ſince amongſt all his Succeſſors. The French (oppoſing his Title by virtue of a pretended Salique Law, diſabling Women from the Succeſſion to the Crown) he overthrew in two great Battels, with a ſmall Force under the Conduct of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Edward the Black Prince his Son, Duke of Aquitain. Thoſe were the <hi>Battels</hi> of <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Poitiers,</hi> the firſt being fought Anno 1343, in the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> VI, ſurnamed <hi>de Valois,</hi> and that of Poitiers in the Reign of his Son King <hi>John,</hi> who was taken Priſoner with Philip his Son, and brought over into England. But ſuch is the Viciſſitude of Humane Affairs, that the Engliſh ſoon after loſt all they had got in theſe Wars, <hi>Calais</hi> excepted. For Charles V, of France, the Son of John, proved too hard for Richard II, of England, one of our unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kings, the next Succeſſor of King Edward III, and his Grandſon by Edward the Black Prince.</p>
                     <p>But Henry V, his next Succeſſor but one, did ſo far purſue the Title of France, that he won it, after he had won the great Battle of <hi>Agin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> which happened Anno 1415. The Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was great, whether we conſider the Weakneſs and diſtracted Condition of Charles VI, then King of France, or the very Diſtraction of the Kingdom at that time occaſioned by the Faction of Burgundy againſt that of Orleans. So that, being ſought to for Peace, he granted it with theſe Conditions, that upon his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Lady Catharine, Daughter to King Charles, he ſhould be made Regent of France, during Charles his Life, and after the Death of Charles, the Crown of France and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ever ſince Things have remained much in the ſame Poſture, the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with the Title to France, and the French Kings with the Poſſeſſion. Nay we have had two Kings of late ſo paſſionately inamoured with the preſent French King, that far from attempting to take the leaſt Flower of his Crown from him, have promoted his Greatneſs, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his Rapines and unjuſt Uſurpations. The Scope whereof at laſt appeared to be no leſs than the Inſlaving this Nation, with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of France; and, far from raiſing the Glory of the Engliſh, to make them an Object of Scorn and Contempt to the World.</p>
                     <p>But now we are bleſt with a wiſe, juſt, and magnanimous King, three Vertues that have been long abſent from the Throne of England, we may hope ſhortly to ſee France, if not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered again, at leaſt ſo humbled and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it ſhall not be in her power to inſult and incroach upon her Neighbours as ſhe has in our Time, to the Ruin and Deſolation of the beſt Part of Europe.

                     <p>In ſhort, the King is the Fountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Juſtice, and Mercy.

                     <p>In point of Phyſick, by an ancient Record, it is declared, That no Phyſick ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to the King, without a Warrant ſigned by the Privy Council, by no other Phyſician but what is mentioned in the Warrant, and the Phyſicians to prepare it themſelves with their own hands.

                     <p>'Tis true, the King of England is not free to act contrary to, or to diſpenſe with the known eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Laws. Neither can he of himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal a Law, or make any new Law, without the Concurrence of both Houſes of Parliament. A happy Impotency, both to King and People. For, whilſt the King keeps within the Bounds of the Law, he can do no Wrong, and the People can receive no Harm.</p>
                     <p>Had the late King but acted accordingly, he might have been a moſt glorious Monarch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being now a general Object of Pity. Far from being neceſſitated to creep under the ſhelter of a Proud Monarch, he might have been a Curb to his Pride, and the Refuge of many Nations that ſuffered Fire and Sword, to advance what he called his Glory.

                     <p>As to the <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of the Kings of England, when all Chriſtendom in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was divided into Nations, the Engliſh was one of the Principal, and not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern, having its Voice of equal ballance with the Nations of France or Italy. In thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49236:249"/>Councils the Emperor of Germany was counted <hi>Major Filius Eccleſiae,</hi> the King of France <hi>Minor Filius,</hi> and the King of England <hi>Filius tertius &amp; adoptivus.</hi> Whereas, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, methinks it had been more proper, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſuch Aſſemblies, to look upon the King of England as <hi>Primogenitus Eccleſiae,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of the Church, out of reſpect to the Britiſh King <hi>Lucius,</hi> who (as I ſaid before) was the firſt King in the World that imbraced Chriſtianity. In thoſe Councils, the King of France had place next the Emperour on his right hand, the King of England next on his left hand, and the King of Scotland next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Caſtille.</p>
                     <p>However the King of England acknowledges no Precedence to any Monarch, but only to the Emperour, and that upon the Score of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.

                     <p>Thus Their Majeſties, with all the Nobility in Crimſon-Velvet Robes and their Coronets in their hands, and the reſt of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being richly habited, or wearing their proper and peculiar Robes, proceeded on foot upon blue Cloth, ſpread from the Steps of the Throne in Weſtminſter-Hall to the Steps of the Theater in the Quire of the Collegiate Church of S. Peter Weſtminſter. The whole Paſſage was Railed in and Garded
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49236:254"/>with Their Majeſties Horſe and Foot-Gards, all the Way and Houſes on each ſide being Crowded with vaſt Number of Spectators, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their great Joy and Satisfaction by loud repeated Acclamations.</p>
                     <p>Being entred the Church, and the Nobility and others all duly placed, Their Majeſties aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Theater. Who being ſeated in their Chairs of State, the Biſhop of London, who performed this great Solemnity, began with the Recognition, which ended with a mighty Shout. Then Their Majeſties Offered, and the Lords who bore the Regalia preſented them at the Altar, where they were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited.</p>
                     <p>After that, the Litany was ſung by two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. And after the Epiſtle, Goſpel, and Nicene Creed, the Biſhop of Salisbury began the Sermon, his Text being taken out of 2 Sam. 23. V. 3 &amp; 4.</p>
                     <p>The Sermon ended, Their Majeſties took the Oath. And, being conducted to their Regal Chairs placed on the Theater, that they might be more conſpicuous to the Members of the Houſe of Commons who were ſeated in the North-Croſs, They were Anointed. After the Unction they were preſented with the Spurs and Sword, inveſted with the Palls and Orbs, and then with the Rings and Scepters. At four of the Clock the Crowns were put upon their Heads; at ſight whereof all the People ſhouted, the Drums and Trumpets ſounded, the great Guns were diſcharged, and the Peers and Peereſſes put on their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets.</p>
                     <p>Then the Bible was preſented to Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties; and, after the Benediction. They vouchſafed to kiſs the Biſhops. Being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49236:255"/>firſt the Biſhops, and then the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords did their Homage, and Kiſſed Their Majeſties left Cheeks. In the mean while the Treaſurer of the Houſhold threw about the Coronation Medals; which were of Silver, about the bigneſs of a half-crown Piece, repreſenting of one ſide the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> with their Names thus, <hi>Gulielmus &amp; Maria Rex &amp; Regina.</hi> And, on the Reverſe, giddy-brained <hi>Phaethon,</hi> unskilfully guiding the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the Sun; with <hi>Jupiter</hi> above ſtriking him with a Thunder-bolt; and this <hi>Motto</hi> about it, <hi>Ne Totus Abſumatur,</hi> that is, Leſt the whole World be Conſumed with fire. A very pat Emblem to the preſent Juncture, as thoſe may beſt judge who are well acquainted with the Story of <hi>Phaethon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, followed the Communion. And Their Majeſties, having made Their ſecond Oblation, received the holy Sacrament. Then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop read the final Prayers. After Prayers, Their Majeſties retired into S. Edward's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where they were new Arrayed in Purple Velvet. And in this Habit they returned to Weſtminſter-Hall, with Their rich Crowns of State upon their Heads, and the Nobility their Coronets.</p>
                     <p>A ſplendid Dinner being prepared in the Hall for Their Majeſties, and the whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the firſt Courſe for Their Majeſties Table was ſerved up with the proper Ceremony, being preceded by the great Officers, and the High Conſtable, High Steward, and Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal. But the Tables of the Nobility, &amp;c. were all ready furniſhed, before their Coming in.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49236:255"/>
                     <p>Before the ſecond Courſe, <hi>Charles Dymoke</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Their Majeſties Champion, came into the Hall on horſe-back, between the High Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and the Earl Marſhal; where be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Challenge. After which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds proclaimed Their Majeſties Styles.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being ended, and the whole Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty performed with great Splendour and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, Their Majeſties about eight in the Evening returned to Whitehall.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the King's peculiar Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Alſo, of His Power, Court, and Revenues, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEſides the Royal Marks of Sovereignty inherent in the Crown of England, the King has certain Priviledges, properly called by the Name of <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> which are ſo many Flowers of the Crown. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal are theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, all Eſtates, for want of Heirs, or by Forfeiture, eſcheat (or revert) to the King. To Him alſo belong all Lands of Aliens, dying before Naturalization or Denization, unleſs they leave Iſſue born within his Dominions; All Waſte Ground or Land recovered from the Sea; All Gold and Silver Mines, in whoſe Ground ſoever they are found; All Wayfs,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49236:256"/>Strays, and Wracks, not granted away by Him or any of his Predeceſſors; All Treaſure found, as Gold, Silver, Plate, Bullion, &amp;c. the Owner whereof is unknown; All Royal Fiſhes, as Whales, Dolphins, &amp;c. And Royal Fowl, as Swans not markt, and ſwimming at liberty on the River.</p>
                     <p>The King, by his Prerogative, has the Right of Pre-emption of all Sorts of Victuals near the Court; and may take Horſes, Carts, Ships, and Boats, for his Carriages, at reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rates.</p>
                     <p>By his Letters Patent he may erect new Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Univerſities, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Schools, Hoſpitals, Fairs, Markets, Foreſts, Chaſes, Free-Warrens, &amp;c. And, without his Authority, no Foreſt, Chaſe, or Park can be made, or Caſtle built.</p>
                     <p>He has Power likewiſe to Infranchiſe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien, and make him a Deniſon, whereby he is inabled to purchaſe Houſes and Lands, and to bear ſome Offices. But none can be Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized but by King and Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The King only can give Letters of Mart or Repriſal. And, in caſe of Loſſes by Fire or otherwiſe, He only can give Patents to receive the charitable Benevolences of the People, without which no Man may ask it publickly.</p>
                     <p>Debts due to the King are in the firſt place to be ſatisfied, in caſe of Executorſhip and Adminiſtratorſhip; and, till the Kings Debts be ſatisfied, He may protect the Debtor from the Arreſt of other Creditors.</p>
                     <p>He may Diſtrein for the whole Rent upon one Tenant, tho he do not hold the whole Land; Is not obliged to demand his Rent, as others are; and may ſue in what Court he pleaſes, and Diſtrain where he liſt.</p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:49236:256"/>
                     <p>No Occupancy can ſtand good againſt the King, nor any Entry before Him prejudice him. And the Sale of the Kings Goods in open Market do's not take away his Property therein.</p>
                     <p>All Receivers of Mony for the King, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants to Him for any Branch of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, are chargeable for the ſame at all times, in their Perſons, Lands, Goods, Heirs, Executors, and Adminiſtrators.</p>
                     <p>And, when any Debtor to the King is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to pay him, by reaſon of Debts owing him which he has not been able to recover, in ſuch a Caſe the Kings Debtor being Plaintiff has ſome Priviledges above others, by virtue of a <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>In Doubtfull Caſes, always there ought to be a particular Regard and favourable Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for the King. And Judgments againſt the King's Title are always entred with a <hi>Salvo Jure Domini Regis;</hi> That if at any time the King's Council at Law can make out his Title better, that Judgment ſhall not prejudice Him. Which is not ſo for a Subject.</p>
                     <p>The King's Servants in Ordinary are free from Arreſt; alſo, from all Offices that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Attendance, as Sheriff, Conſtable, Church-Warden, &amp;c. And, for reaſonable Cauſes Him thereunto moving, He may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect any Man againſt Suits at Law, &amp;c. with a <hi>Noli Proſequi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to Church Matters, the King by Act of Parliament is the Supream Head of the Church, as He is of the State; and is lookt upon as her Gardian, and Nurſing Father.</p>
                     <p>He is (as Conſtantine the Emperor ſaid of himſelf) an external Biſhop of the Church, and in ſome Senſe a Prieſt aſwell as a King. Therefore at his Coronation He is Anointed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49236:257"/>with Oyl, as the Prieſts were at firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Kings of Iſrael, to intimate that his Perſon is Sacred and Spiritual; and has the <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> and other Prieſtly Veſts, put upon Him.</p>
                     <p>By virtue of his Prerogative, He has Power to call a National or Provincial Synod; and to make ſuch Alterations in the Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline as they ſhall judge expedient.</p>
                     <p>And, as He is the Lord Paramount, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Landlord, of all the Lands in England; ſo He has all over England the Supream Right of Patronage, called Patronage Paramount. Inſomuch that, if the mean Patron, or the Ordinary, or the Metropolitan, preſent not in due time, the Right of Preſentation comes at at laſt to the King.</p>
                     <p>As for the Biſhopricks, the King only has the Patronage of them. For none can be choſen Biſhop, but whom he nominates in his <hi>Conge d'Eſtire;</hi> and a Biſhop Elect cannot be Conſecrated, or take poſſeſſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Biſhoprick, without the King's ſpecial Writ or Aſſent.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, as the King is the only Sovereign and Supream Head both in Church and State, ſo there lies no Appeal from Him, as from ſome other States and Kingdoms beyond Sea, either to the Pope of Rome, or to the Emperor.</p>
                     <p>But indeed the greateſt and ſafeſt of the Kings Prerogatives is, as the preſent King wrote in a late Letter to his Council of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to Rule according to Law, and with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                     <p>The Diſpenſing Power, ſo much contended for in the late Reign by the Court-Party as a Branch of the Kings Prerogative, and as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſed by ſome true Patriots, is

                        </gap>ow quite out of Doors by the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes it plainly Illegal.</p>
                     <p>And, as to that divine Prerogative which the Kings of England claimed as a Thing <hi>de Jure divino,</hi> I mean the Curing of the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> only by the King's laying his hands on the Sick, aſſiſted with a ſhort Form of Divine Service, it is now laid aſide, as a Traditional Errour, at leaſt a Doctrine not fit to be truſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o. So that the French King is at this time the only Monarch that pretends to this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Priviledge. Our Hiſtorians derived it here from King Edward the Confeſſour, who lived ſo holy a Life, that (as they ſay) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Power from above, Intailed to his Royal Succeſſors for ever, to cure this ſtubborn Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But now 'cis lookt upon as a Doctrine not ſo fit for Proteſtants as bigotted Papiſts, to whom no Miracle is amiſs.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the King's <hi>Power,</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forein Parts; Which I ſhall deſcribe as near as I can, firſt as Defenſive, ſecondly as Offenſive.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt Senſe, <hi>England,</hi> if well united, is of all the States in Europe the leaſt ſubject to an Invaſion, eſpecially ſince the Conjunction of Scotland. The whole Iſland is naturally ſo well ſenced with the Ocean, and (when Occaſion requires) ſo well garded by thoſe moving Caſtles, the King's Ships of War, the ſtrongeſt and beſt built in the whole World. The Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is ſo abundantly furniſhed with Men and Horſes, with Proviſions and Ammunition, and Mony the Sinews of War, that nothing but our inteſtine Diviſions can make us a Prey to the greateſt Potentates of Europe, tho uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together.</p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49236:258"/>
                     <p>As for the King's Power abroad, not only our Neighbours, but the moſt remote Places, have ſufficiently felt it, and this at a time when Scotland and Ireland were uſually at enmity with Him. 'Tis true, ſince the Reign of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Only, in Cromwel's Time, we humbled the Hollanders, ſcowred the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines, kept the French and the Pope in aw, and took Jamaica from Spain.

Then were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted about two hundred thouſand Foot, and fifty thouſand Horſe, to be in Arms on both, ſides; which, had they been imploy'd abroad, might have ſhaken the greateſt part of Europe.

                     <p>The next Thing that offers it ſelf to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is the King of England's <hi>Court,</hi> which for State, Greatneſs, and good Order, beſides the conſtant Concourſe of Nobility and Gentry reſorting thither, when there is no Jealouſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his People, is one of the chief Courts of Europe. It is, as an Author ſays, a Monarchy within a Monarchy, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, and Military Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the two laſt under their proper Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>To ſupport the Grandure of this Court, and the other Charges of the Crown in time of Peace, the Kings of England have always had competent <hi>Revenues.</hi> Which never were raiſed by any of thoſe ſordid Ways uſed in other Countries; but conſiſt chiefly in Domains or Lands belonging to the Crown, in Cuſtoms, and Exciſe.</p>
                     <p>Anciently the very Domains of the Crown, and Fee-Farm Rents, were ſo conſiderable, that they were almoſt ſufficient to diſcharge all the ordinary Expences of the Crown, without any Tax or Impoſt upon the Subject. Then there was ſcarce a County in England but the King
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49236:259"/>had in it a Royal Caſtle, a Foreſt, and a Park, to Receive and Divert Him in his Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes. A piece of Grandure, which no King elſe could boaſt of. But, upon the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King Charles, the Crown Revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found much Impaired, and the Crown Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges increaſing upon the growing Greatneſs of our Neighbours the French and Dutch, the Parliament ſettled upon the King a Yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of Twelve Hundred Thouſand Pounds, by ſeveral Impoſts; beſides the Domains and other Profits ariſing to the Crown in Tenths and Firſt-Fruits, in Reliefs, Fines, Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Confiſcations. And the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue improved to that degree, that in the late Reign it was judged to amount to near two Millions. Which is a Fair Revenue in Time of Peace.</p>
                     <p>In Time of War, the Parliament ſupplies the King, according to his Occaſions, by ſuch Taxes to be raiſed upon the Nation as they think moſt convenient.</p>

                     <p>THere are three Caſes, wherein the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England is not immediately governed by the King, but by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Regent. And thoſe are the Kings Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Abſence, or Incapacity.</p>
                     <p>The King is by Law under Age, when he is under twelve Years old. And, till he has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that Age, the Kingdom is governed by a <hi>Regent, Protector,</hi> or <hi>Gardian,</hi> appointed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the King his Predeceſſor, or (for want of ſuch Appointment,) by the Three States aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Name of the Infant King.

                     <p>Thus, in the Caſe of Edward VI, the Duke of Somerſet, his Uncle by the Mothers ſide, was made Lord Protector during the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority.

The <hi>Welch</hi> being diſguſted at this, He ſent for his Queen, then great with Child, to <hi>Caernarvan,</hi> where ſhe was delivered of a Son. Upon the News whereof, the King aſſembled the Chief Men of that Nation, and offered to name them a Governour born in <hi>Wales,</hi> who could not ſpeak one word of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and againſt whoſe Life they could take no juſt exception. Such a one when they had all ſworn to obey, he named his young Son Edward. Whereupon He created him Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> and ſince that time, the Kings of England el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sons have been called Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi> Whereas, while Normandy was in the Power of the Engliſh, which laſted till the Reign of King John, they were ſtiled Dukes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</p>
                     <p>The Inveſtiture is performed by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Cap of Eſtate, and a Coronet on the Princes Head, as a Token of his Principality; by delivering into his hand a Verge of Gold, the Emblem of Government; by putting a Gold Ring on his Finger, in token that he muſt be a Husband to his Country, and a Father to her Children; and by giving him a Patent, to hold the ſaid Principality to Him and his Heirs Kings of England. By which Words the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it from the Crown is prohibited, and the King keeps to himſelf an excellent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49236:263"/>of obliging unto Him his Son, when he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>In Imitation of which Cuſtom, John I, King of Caſtille and Leon, made his Son Henry Prince of the <hi>Aſturias;</hi> a Country ſo Craggy and Mountainous, that it may not improperly be called the <hi>Wales</hi> of Spain. And all the Spaniſh Princes ever ſince have been honoured with that Title.</p>
                     <p>The Mantle worn in Parliament by the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> has (for Diſtinctions ſake) one gard more than a Duke's; his Coronet, of Croſſes and Flower de luces, and his Cap of State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented.</p>
                     <p>His Arms differ from the Kings, only by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Label of three points. And his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Device is a Coronet beautified with three Oſtrich Feathers, inſcribed with ICH DIEN, that is, I ſerve; Alluding perhaps to that in the Goſpel, <hi>The Heir, while he is a Child, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from a Servant.</hi> Which Device was born at the Battel of <hi>Creſſy</hi> by John King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, ſerving there under the French King, and there ſlain by Edward the Black Prince. Since worn by the Princes of Wales, and by the Vulgar called the Princes Arms.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the King of England's Eldeſt Son has ever ſince been ſtiled Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint;</hi> theſe Earldoms being conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by Letters Patent. As Eldeſt Son to the King of Scotland, he is Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> and Seneſchal of <hi>Scotland</hi> from his Birth.</p>
                     <p>Though he is a Subject, yet the Law looks upon his Perſon as ſo Sacred, that it is high Treaſon to imagine his Death, or violate his Wife.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49236:263"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Younger Sons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> depend altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the King's Favour, both for Titles, of Honour, and Revenues ſutable to their Birch. For they are not born Dukes, or Earls; but are ſo created, according to the Kings Pleaſure. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they, as in France, certain <hi>Appana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> but only what Revenue the King pleaſes to beſtow upon them.</p>
                     <p>They are indeed by Birth-right, as well as the Prince of Wales, Counſellors of State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may fit themſelves to manage the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Daughters</hi> are called Princeſſes. And, to violate them unmarried is High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Title of Royal Highneſs is common to all the King's Children. All Subjects ought to be uncovered in their Preſence, to kneel when they are admitted to kiſs their hands, and to be ſerved on the Knee at Table, unleſs the King be preſent.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, all Perſons of the Royal Bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lawful Iſſue, have the Precedency of all others in England.</p>
                     <p>As for the King's Natural (or Illegitimate) Sons and Daughters, they are commonly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Dukes and Dutcheſſes; and bear what Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name the King pleaſes to give them. King Henry I. and Charles II. <hi>of bleſſed Memory,</hi> are noted to have had the moſt of any.</p>

                     <p>The Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the higheſt Officer under the King. His Office not unlike that of the <hi>Mayre of the Pallace</hi> under the ancient Kings of France, is to rule and govern the Kingdom under the King, in Time of Peace and War, during his Reign, Which Power being thought too large and exorbitant for a Subject to have, this Great Officer has been diſcontinned ever ſince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrock,</hi> Son to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaſter, afterwards King of England under the Name of Henry IV. Only at a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, alſo for the Trial of a Peer or Peereſs for Treaſon or Felony, or ſome other great Crime, the King makes a High Steward for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49236:264"/>that Time. Who, during his Stewardſhip, is called <hi>His Grace;</hi> and bears a <hi>white Staff</hi> in his hand, which he openly breaks when the Buſineſs is over, and ſo ends his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>By virtue of his Office at a Coronation, he ſits Judicially at the King's Pallace at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter. Where he receives the Bills and Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all ſuch Noblemen and others, who (by reaſon of their Tenure, or otherwiſe) claim to do Services at the King's Coronation, and to receive the accuſtomed Fees and Allowances. In the Proceſſion on the Coronation-Day, 'tis he that carries the King's Crown. The Right Honourable the Earl of Devonſhire was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with this great Office in the laſt Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Trial of a Peer he ſits under a Cloth of State, and his Commiſſion is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>ſecundum Legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Angliae.</hi> He is not Sworn, nor the Lords who are the Tryers of the Peer arraigned; and, tho he call all the Judges of the Land to aſſiſt him; yet he is the ſole Judge.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Lord High Steward is the <hi>Lord High Chancellour,</hi> who in Civil Affairs (now there is no High Steward) is the higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Kingdom next to the Royal Family, as the Arch-biſhop of Canterbury is in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</p>
                     <p>His Oath is to do Right to all manner of People, rich and poor, after the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm, truly to counſel the King, and keep ſecret the King's Counſel, to ſtand for the Rights of the Crown, &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:49236:265"/>
                     <p>The Great Seal of England is in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. He is the Judge of the Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, otherwiſe called the Court of Equity; where he is to judge, not according to the Rigour and Letter of the Law, but with Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conſcience. He alſo beſtow's all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Benefices in the King's Gift under 20 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year in the King's Books.</p>
                     <p>Since the Reign of Henry VII. this great Office has been commonly executed by Lawyers; whereas formerly Biſhops, and other Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men learned in the Civil Laws, were uſually intruſted with it.</p>
                     <p>The Lord High Chancellour holds his Place but <hi>durante Regis Beneplacito,</hi> during the King's Pleaſure. And his Place is counted to be worth 8000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a Year.</p>
                     <p>Anciently he had ſometimes a Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, commonly called Keeper of the Great Seal. But of later Times they differ only in Name. For the late Kings have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Great Seal, either with the Title of Lord Keeper, or of Lord Chancellour; but ſtill with the ſame Power, and Right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence. Only the Lord Chancellour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Patent from the King for his Office, which the Lord Keeper do's not; and by the Title of Chancellour he is lookt upon as in greater favour with the King.</p>
                     <p>But his preſent Majeſty, ſince his Acceſſion to the Crown, thought fit to have this Office managed by Commiſſioners; and accordingly it has been hitherto managed by <hi>three Lords Commiſſioners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Great Officer of the Crown is the <hi>Lord High Treaſurer,</hi> who has the Charge and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49236:265"/>Government of all the King's Revenue kept in the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>He has the Gift of all Cuſtomers, Comptro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Searchers in all the Ports of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and the Nomination of all Eſcheators in every County. He has alſo the Check of all the Officers imploy'd in collecting all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Crown. He has power either by himſelf, or with others joyned in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with him, to let Leaſes of all the Crown-Lands. And it is he that gives Warrants to certain Perſons of Quality, to have their Wine Cuſtom-free.</p>
                     <p>Anciently he received this Office and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the delivery of the golden Keys of the Treaſury, which is now done by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a white Staff to him by the King.</p>
                     <p>His Oath do's not differ much from that of the Lord Chancellour; and he holds his Place, as he do's, during his Majeſties Pleaſure. His Place is alſo reckoned to be worth 8000 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                        <hi>per ann.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this great Office is now executed by four Perſons, called the <hi>Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next is the <hi>Lord Preſident of the King's Privy Council,</hi> an Officer as ancient as King John's Time, made by the King's Letters Patent under the Great Seal, <hi>durante Beneplacito.</hi> His Office is to manage the Debates in Council, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Matters from the King, and report the Tranſactions to his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>In the late Reigns this Office was often ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Chancellour.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Lord Preſident is the <hi>Lord Privy Seal,</hi> whoſe Office is of great Truſt and Skill. He is ſo called from the Privy Seal,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49236:266"/>which is in his cuſtody. All Charters and Grants of the King, and all Pardons ſigned by the King, paſs through his hands, before they come to the Great Seal of England. And h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>This Office is Hereditary, and belongs to the Earls of Lindſey.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lord High Conſtable</hi> is another great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, but of too great Authority and Power to be continued, and therefore is only created for the Solemnity of the King's Coronation. The Duke of Ormond was High Conſtable in the laſt.</p>
                     <p>The next is the <hi>Earl Marſhal of England,</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of great Antiquity, and anciently of great Power. His proper Office is to ſummon the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the King's Coronation, with ſuch Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for State and publick Appearance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that Solemnity.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of Their preſent Majeſties, King</hi> WILLIAM <hi>and Queen</hi> MARY, <hi>With a brief Account of Their Acceſſion to the Crown.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>KING <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> our preſent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, is the only Iſſue of the late Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of Orange, and of the Deceaſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Royal <hi>Mary,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to King Charles I, who was wedded to the foreſaid Prince in the Year 1641.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty was born in Holland Nov. 4th 1650, ten days after his Fathers Death; and was Chriſtened by the Names of <hi>William Henry, William</hi> being his Fathers Name, and <hi>Henry</hi> his Grandfathers.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> is an Ancient and moſt Illuſtrious Family, ſo called from <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> a Town and County in <hi>Weteravia</hi> a Province of Germany. That Branch of it from whence the King is deſcended had their uſual Seat at <hi>Dillenburg,</hi> not far from <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> before they ſettled in the Low-Countries; whence, for Diſtinctions ſake, they were named the Earls of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Dillenburg.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Otho</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> who died Anno 1190, was the Founder of the preſent Family of the Princes of <hi>Orange;</hi> out of which deſcended <hi>Adolph,</hi> Earl of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> who was choſen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in the Year 1292. By the Marriage of <hi>Engelbert,</hi> the ſeventh Earl of this Houſe, with Mary Daughter and Heir of Philip Lord of <hi>Breda</hi> in Brabant, that Town and Barony, with many other fair Eſtates in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands was added to the Family. And by the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> (the tenth Earl of <hi>Naſſaw</hi>) Anno 1515. with Claude of Chalons, Siſter and Heir of Philibert Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> this Principality, bordering upon Provence and Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phene within the Dominions of France, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to the Family. So much the worſe for having ſo ill an Neighbour as the preſent French King, who has long ſince rapaciouſly ſeized upon it; but left however what he could not take away, the King's juſt Title to it.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, our Gracious King William is the 18th Earl of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> beginning with Otho aforeſaid; and the 7th Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> of his Family, beginning with Rene of Naſſaw, Son of Henry and Claude, who ſucceeded Philibert his Uncle in the Principality of Orange.</p>
                     <p>A Family as much honoured for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Merit of the Princes of it as any other in Europe, and to which the States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ow the Liberty and Greatneſs they injoy. All the World knows how great a Patron and Aſſertor of the Belgick Liberties againſt the Spaniard was the moſt noble and generous Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> one of his Majeſtie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Anceſtors. And, to paſs by the generous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49236:268"/>of his noble Succeſſors till the preſent King William, 'tis well known what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtly has done to reſcue, not only his Native Country, but the beſt Part of Europe from its Oppreſſors.</p>
                     <p>It has been of late Years, both at home and abroad, the Maxim of ſome Princes, to outvy each other in preying upon and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only their Neighbours, but their own Proteſtant Subjects, by all Methods of Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Cruelty. To eſtabliſh or maintain their Tyranny, they went about to introduce a general Ignorance. For where Subjects part with their Reaſon, 'tis eaſy for them to part with their Liberty; witneſs thoſe miſerable Inſlaved Countries where Popery domineers.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary the Houſe of Orange has always appeared againſt that ravenous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Principle. And, as if Providence had appointed them for a Check to Tyranny, God has been pleaſed accordingly to bleſs their juſt Indeavours.</p>
                     <p>Never the Liberty of England, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt in general, lay more at ſtake than it did in the late Reign. 'Tis plain there was a general Deſign to extirpate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Popiſh Senſe, and to inſlave all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The Plot was laid in the Reign of <hi>bleſſed</hi> King Charles, who with a ſhew of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſlantiſm made the Way ſmooth for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. At laſt, when all Things were finely prepared to the hand of his next Heir, King Charles go's off the Stage; and his Brother, to play the laſt Act, enters, and aſcends the Throne.</p>
                     <p>No Prince more Courteous, more Obliging, or more Promiſing at firſt than He was to his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49236:269"/>new Subjects. The Church of England Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in his Exaltation, and Addreſſed Him from all Parts of the Kingdom, as their Tutela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Angel. The People in general look'd upon him as an Incomparable Hero, who would quickly make it his Buſineſs to pull down the Hector of France, and <hi>to carry the Glory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land beyond all his Predeceſſors.</hi> In ſhort, ſo great were the Hopes of this King, that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III, and Henry V, the moſt glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of England, were upon his Account to be hiſſed out of our Engliſh Chronicles.</p>
                     <p>No body dreamed of a <hi>Popiſh Catechiſm,</hi> to be the firſt ſtep to this Glory, nor of an Army to be raiſed for the defence of it. Under whoſe ſhelter, beſides a ſecret League with France, the Prerogative began preſently to ſwell above its Banks, the Laws to be Overwhelmed the Liberty and Property of the Subject Invaded, the Church of England Cruſhed that had raiſed the King to the Throne, Popery crowing over all the Nation, and to crown all their Hopes, <hi>preſto,</hi> a Prince of Wales. In ſhort, to ſpeak in terms of War, the Miner was fix'd, and we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Surrender, or be Stormed.</p>
                     <p>This was our Condition, when the Prince of Orange (our preſent King) undertook our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and effected it, under God, in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner. Upon whoſe Approach our <hi>Maſs-Hero</hi> fled, left us to ſhift for our ſelves, and the Popiſh Party to the mercy of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

This Liberty they got ſince this Change by Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church of England Members, and the King's Aſſent to it; but now it won't ſerve their turn. If nothing will pleaſe them but to ſee a Church run down that ſtood alone at the Gap in the late Reign, that ſo learnedly baffled all the Popiſh Writers, and was therefore by a Roman Decree to be ſtript of all, and deſtroyed, when the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were much in favour in that Court, God forbid they ſhould ever be pleaſed. The King knows who are the beſt Friends to the Crown, and upon whom he may ſafely rely. He loves all his Subjects, but perhaps not all alike.</p>
                     <p>The Miſchief is, that ſome of our <hi>Churchmen</hi> are alſo out of Humour, or rather out of order.

                     <p>Under the Dean there is a <hi>Sub-Dean,</hi> or <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor Capellae;</hi> and next to him 12 <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Whereof ones peculiar Office is to read the firſt Morning Prayers to the Kings Houſhold, to viſit the Sick, to examine and prepare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, and to do all other Duties-proper for his Station.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Prieſts there are 20 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, commonly called the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> (or <hi>Clerks</hi>) <hi>of the Chappel;</hi> who, with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prieſts, perform in the Chappel the Office of Divine Service in Praying, Singing, &amp;c.

                     <p>And, as Lent is a particular Time of the Year for Devotion (tho it is not obſerved in England with that Strictneſs and Superſtition as it is in the Roman States) ſo the Royal Chappel ſhews an excellent Example, at that time eſpecially, to all other Churches and Chappels of England.</p>
                     <p>In order to which the Lord Chamberlain, ſome time before Lent, do's appoint the <hi>Lent-Preachers,</hi> and cauſes a Liſt of them to be printed, with their reſpective Times for Preaching during Lent. Then the Sermon-Days are Wedneſdays, Fridays, and Sundays, Weekly. The firſt Wedneſday, being Aſh-Wedneſday, is fixt for the <hi>Dean of the Chappel</hi> to preach before the King; and the Friday after for the <hi>Dean of S.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49236:288"/>Altar, which by the Dean of the Chappel is diſtributed afterwards among the Poor. The ſame is a Sum of Gold, to this day called the <hi>Beſant,</hi> or the <hi>Bizantine,</hi> from <hi>Bizantium</hi> the old Name of Conſtantinople, where the piece of Gold was coined which anciently was Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Kings of England. The Gold to be offered is delivered to the King and Queen by the Lord Steward, or ſome other of the principal Officers; and it is Offered to God by Their Majeſties, as an Acknowledgement that by his Grace They hold their Kingdoms of him.</p>
                     <p>The other Days of the Year on which they make the ſame Offering, are All-Saints, New-Years Day, Candlemas, Annunciation, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Day, S.

                     <p>The <hi>Lord Almoner</hi> is uſually a Biſhop.

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of their preſent</hi> Majeſties <hi>Land and Sea Forces, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THeir Majeſties Land-Forces are either <hi>Ordinary,</hi> as the Horſe and Foot Guards, the ſeveral Garriſons, and the ſtanding Militia of the Country. Or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> as the preſent victorious Army in Ireland.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot-Guards</hi> I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the foregoing Account of the King and Queens Court, where it appears they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 7000 Men at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>The principal <hi>Garriſoned Places</hi> in England are <hi>Portſmouth, Plimouth,</hi> the <hi>Tower of London, Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor-Caſtle, Cheſter, Carliſle, Hull, Berwick, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Caſtle,</hi> and theſe two Forts on the Thames, <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> and <hi>Tilbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Iſle of Wight there are conſtant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, at <hi>Cowes, Sandham Fort, Weſt-Yarmouth,</hi> and <hi>Carisbrook.</hi> So there is at <hi>Hurſt</hi> and <hi>Calſhot Caſtles,</hi> upon two Points of Hampſhire ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into the Sea over againſt the ſaid Iſle. To which add <hi>Upner Caſtle</hi> in Kent, <hi>Landguard Fort</hi> in Suffolk, <hi>Clifford Tower</hi> and <hi>Scarborough Caſtle</hi> in Yorkſhire, <hi>Tinmouth Caſtle</hi> in Northumberland, and <hi>Holy Iſland</hi> near the Coaſt of that County, <hi>S. Maries Caſtle</hi> among
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49236:291"/>the Iſles of Scilly, <hi>Pendennis</hi> in Cornwal, and <hi>Portland Caſtle</hi> in Dorſetſhire. Beſides the Iſlands of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Garnſey,</hi> on the Coaſt of Normandy.</p>
                     <p>The Number of Men in each of thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons is uncertain; for it is greater or leſſer, as Occaſion ſerves. Moſt of them are unregimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Companies.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, together with the Royal Guards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtanding Land-Forces in Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Pay, there is for the Paying of them, firſt a general Officer, called the <hi>Pay-Maſter General,</hi> who has ſeveral Clerks under him.</p>
                     <p>Next is the <hi>Commiſſary General of the Muſters,</hi> who has a <hi>Deputy Commiſſary</hi> in London; beſides eight other <hi>Deputy-Commiſſaries,</hi> who have their diſtinct Circuits in the Country, for Muſtering the Forces which lye in the ſeveral Garriſons.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a <hi>Secretary at War,</hi> with ſeveral Clerks, and a Meſſenger under him.</p>
                     <p>Which three conſiderable Offices are kept at the Horſe-Guard.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is a <hi>Judge Advocate,</hi> a <hi>Scout-Maſter General,</hi> an <hi>Adjutant General,</hi> and a <hi>Marſhal of the Horſe;</hi> beſides a <hi>Chirurgeon Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongſt Their Majeſties Land Forces we may reckon the <hi>Militia,</hi> or <hi>Train Bands</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very County, as being wholly at the King's Diſpoſal, and bound to Aſſiſt Him upon all Occaſions within the Bounds of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>In Queen Elizabeth's Time a general Muſter was made, by her Order, of all Men able to bear Arms, from the Age of 16 to 60; who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49236:291"/>then amounted to three Millions of Men, whereof ſix hundred Thouſand fit for War. But, in Time of Peace, the Matter is ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that there is not above one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and Foot actually Inrolled for the Defence of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>The Management whereof is in the hands of the <hi>Lord Lieutenants</hi> of the ſeveral Counties of England, who are uſually of the principal Rank amongſt the Peers of the Realm, choſen for that purpoſe by the King, and ſo created by his Commiſſion. They have Power by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to charge any Perſon with Horſe, Horſemen, and Arms, that has 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> a Year, or 6000 <abbr>l.</abbr> perſonal Eſtate; and with a Foot Souldier, any Perſon that has 50 <abbr>l.</abbr> yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, or 600 <abbr>l.</abbr> perſonal Eſtate. Thoſe that have meaner Eſtates are to joyn two or three together, either to find a Horſe and Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Foot Souldier, according to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
                     <p>They have alſo Power to Arm, Array, and Form the Forces into Companies, Troops, and Regiments, and to make their Officers by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them Commiſſions; and, upon any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or Invaſion, to lead and imploy the Men ſo Armed within their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or into any other County, as the King ſhall give Order.</p>
                     <p>They name their <hi>Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> and preſent them to the King, for his Confirmation. Who are to be of the principal Gentry of the Country, and have the ſame Power as the Lord Lieutenant in his abſence.</p>
                     <p>To find out Ammunition and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, there is a Tax of 70000 <abbr>l.</abbr> a Month upon the whole Kingdom, whereof the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants or Deputies, or any three (or more) of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49236:292"/>them, may levy a Fourth Part of each Mans Proportion in it. And, when occaſion ſhall be to bring the Militia into actual Service, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo charged are to provide each Souldier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively with pay in hand for a Month, at the rate of 2 ſhill. a Day for a Horſeman, and 12 pence for a Foot Souldier. For Repayment of which Mony, and the ſatisfaction of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for their Pay, during the time aforeſaid, Proviſion is to be made by the King out of the publick Revenue; and, till the ſame be actually performed, none can be charged with another Months Pay.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Forces are always to be in readineſs, with all Things neceſſary at the beat of Drum, or ſound of Trumpet, to appear, muſter, and be at certain times trained and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Now, to give ſpeedy notice of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Invaſion, there are all over England high Poles erected upon eminent Places both Inland and Maritime, with Pitch-barrels faſtened on the Top, known by the name of <hi>Beacons.</hi> Which being ſet on fire, one by the ſight of another, the whole Kingdom has thereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in few Hours of the approaching Danger. Whereupon the Militia, to ſecure the Kingdom, makes haſte to the Sea-Coaſts.</p>
                     <p>As for the preſent <hi>Army,</hi> which God has lately bleſt with a glorious Victory, carrying with it the Reduction of Ireland, and (I hope) a Fate upon France, it was lately Computed to be near Fifty thouſand ſtrong, Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons; conſiſting of Engliſh, Iriſh, French, Daniſh, and Dutch Forces.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh, for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, that I could give a particular and exact Account of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49236:292"/>this brave and gallant Army. But, rather than do it imperfectly, I beg the Reader's leave to decline it.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I come to the <hi>Maritime Power</hi> of England. Which conſiſts in general of about 130 <hi>Men of War;</hi> beſides <hi>Fireſhips, Yachts, Hulks, Ketches, Sloops, Hays,</hi> and <hi>Smacks,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Veſſels for Tenders and Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
                     <p>The Men of War are divided into ſix Rates, or Ranks; Built in ſeveral Places, but moſt at <hi>Woolwich, Chatham, Deptford, Blackwall, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Liſt gives you the Names of them, according to their Rates, in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betick Order, with the Year when they were built; alſo the Number of Tuns, Men, and Guns each of them commonly carries abroad in Time of War. Thoſe whoſe Names be in the Roman Letter, are the Thirty that were built by an Act of Parliament made in the Year 1676.</p>

                     <p>Now, as to our Men of War in particular, 'tis to be obſerved, that for <hi>Strength</hi> they are Incomparable, being built of Engliſh Timber, which is the moſt excellent for that purpoſe.

                     <p>The <hi>Britannia,</hi> a new Ship, is much the ſame; but that ſhe was not perhaps ſo carefully built as the Royal Sovereign, there being found late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome Defect in the Timber, which is now repairing.</p>

                     <p>To reflect upon what is paſt relating to our Naval Force, this (I confeſs) was much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the late King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſtrange Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Shipping and Seamen, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit and damage of this Nation. Then, and not till then, the French grew upon us; and grew (like a Weed) ſo faſt, that they have been ever ſince a great Diſcouragement and Obſtruction to our Engliſh Trade. To ſee thoſe Sea-Muſhrooms, the French, dare be ſo bold as to crow over the Engliſh, who would not have Imployed them for <hi>Swabbers</hi> ſome Years ſince, 'twere enough to inrage a ſenſible Nation. But, if one may gueſs at future Events from the preſent Diſpoſition of Things, I am apt to think this prodigious <hi>Gallicinium,</hi> or Crowing of the French King, is a Preſage of his Fall. And, without Inquiring into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Cauſes of the late unuſual and wonderful Tameneſs of our Fleet, (which gave him the ſatisfaction to rove a while undiſturbed in our Seas) now ſuch Meaſures are taken as will in all probability make him lower his Top-ſail. As for <hi>Tourville</hi> his Admiral's Exploit at <hi>Ting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Tingmouth,</hi> a ſmall, open, and obſcure Place, the Reſort of a few Fiſhermen who had there ſome Thatched Houſes, was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Stormed, and irreſiſtibly Burnt by this Victorious Fleet. Which, fluſhed with this great Expedition, and its happy Come-off in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight, ſailed few Days after with flying Colours for <hi>Breſt. Breſt,</hi> which expected great Spoils from the Britiſh Shore, and ſome Return for Millions expended to make this proud Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at Sea, wondered to ſee nothing but their Fleet come ſhort home; ſome Ships wanting, and others halting, with part of what Men they had left alive half ſtarved, or ſick to death, as if they had come from <hi>Terra Incognita.</hi> But the <hi>Paris Gazette</hi> made amends, which celebrated this Expedition at that rate, that one would have thought the Venetians Victory over the Turks in the Gulf of Lepanto fell ſhort of this paultry one. And, to raiſe the Credit of the great Exploit at <hi>Tingmouth,</hi> there <hi>Tingmouth</hi> was repreſented as a flouriſhing Harbour, crowded with Men of War, and Merchant Ships richly laden, of which a Sacrifice was made to the new French Neptune. Thus, by a falſe and pompous Relation (which indeed ſounded much to the glory of a Hamlet) the French Court deſigned to amuſe the World, to raiſe on the one ſide the Spirits of the drooping French, and at the ſame time ſtrike an Aw amongſt the Confederates. Which ſhews what ſhifts the French are put to in this Juncture of Time, to ſupport their Reputation.</p>
                     <p>What remains is to give an Account of Their Majeſties <hi>Office of Ordnance,</hi> relating to their Forces both by Sea and Land, and Kept within the Tower of London. Which Office concerns
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49236:299"/>all the principal Preparatives and Inſtruments of War for the Defence and Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and has the ordering and diſpoſing of all the Magazines, as well for Sea as Land.</p>
                     <p>The principal of theſe Magazines is the <hi>Tower,</hi> where there are Arms for 60000 Men, and a fine Train of Artillery Kept, with all ſtores proportionable.</p>
                     <p>This, and all other Magazines in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as thoſe of <hi>Portſmouth, Plimouth, Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> &amp;c.) are under the <hi>Maſter-General of the Ordnance,</hi> a Place of great Truſt, and of a general Influence over all the Kingdom.

                     <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Ordnance</hi> records all Patents and Grants relating to the Office, with the Names of all concerned therein.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE preſent publick Revenues of the King and Queen, as they were lately ſettled by King and Parliament, differ in ſeveral Points from the Settlement made in the Reign of Charles II, and Confirmed to the late King James.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Exciſe</hi> (which conſiſts in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Impoſitions upon Beer, Ale, and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors) is Settled upon Them for their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of Them. But out of it a Yearly Rent of 20000 <abbr>l.</abbr> comes to Her Royal Highneſs, the Princeſs of Denmark, and her Iſſue, during Their Majeſties Lives, and the Survivor of Them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cuſtom</hi> upon Commodities Imported and Exported, which was ſettled upon King Charles II, and afterwards his Succeſſor, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Lives, is now Confined within the Term of four Years, to commence on the 24th Day of December 1690. And that great Branch of the Revenue, the <hi>Hearth-Mony,</hi> which was for ever Settled in the Crown, to the great Grievance of the People, is now lopt off by Act of Parliament, upon the King's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49236:302"/>Motion, for the Relief of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                     <p>As to Their Majeſties other Revenues, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the Ninth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Which, with the Exciſe and Cuſtom, come to above Twelve hundred thouſand Pound a Year, that is about 16 Millions of French Livers. A Revenue which may ſerve in Time of Peace to Keep up the Honour of the Crown, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any Ambitious (or Over-covetous) Prince to Invade the Property and Liberty of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Subjects, or under a vain Pretence of his own Glory to diſturb the Peace and Quiet of his Neighbours. A ſad Experience whereof we have ſeen of late Years by the Practice of that Ambitious Monarch, the French King; whoſe exorbitant Incomes have helped him to Cruſh firſt his Subjects, and then moſt of his Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>But, when the Nation is concerned in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein War, and the War grounded upon Equity and Honour, the Parliaments of England ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of Supplying the King with <hi>Subſidies</hi> ſuitable to the preſent Occaſion, by a Land-Tax, Poll-Mony, and ſuch other Ways as they think moſt convenient.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, as the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Exciſe</hi> are the two principal Branches of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Revenues, let us ſee how the ſame are managed, how the Products thereof come into the Exchequer, and are there diſpoſed of by ſuch thrifty Methods, that (all Charges born) it coſts the King little above 2 Shillings in the Pound.</p>
                     <p>For the Managing of the <hi>Cuſtom-Revenue,</hi> there are in the firſt place at preſent <hi>Seven Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi> who have the Charge and Overſight
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49236:302"/>of all Their Majeſties Cuſtoms in all Ports of England. Which Cuſtoms amount to about 600000 <abbr>l.</abbr> a Year, whereof the Port of London only pays two Thirds, that is about 400000 <abbr>l.</abbr> Yearly</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Commiſſioners ſit day by day at the Cuſtom-Houſe, London, They hold their Places by Patent from the King, and have each a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                        <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Under theſe are a great Number of Officers imployed, both at London and in the Out-Ports, ſome of them of conſiderable quality and ability. Such as <hi>Collectors, Cuſtomers, Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Surveyors, Regiſters, Searchers, Waiters.</hi> &amp;c. whoſe due Perquiſites are ſo conſiderable, that to ſome they are more than their reſpective Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries.

So that when this Book was opened upon any Difference, the Cheat appeared, and Judgement was given according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This Tax-book has been written above 600 Years ago, viz. in the Reign of William the Conquerour, and was ſix Years a making.

                     <p>He that pays any Monies into the Exchequer receives for his Acquittance a Tally, that is, a ſtick with Words written on it on both ſides, containing the Acquittance proper to expreſs what the Mony received is for. This being cloven aſunder by the Deputy-Chamberlains, the Stock is delivered to the Party that paid the Mony, the Counter-ſtock (or Counter-foil) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with them.

He daily receives the ſtate of each Teller's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and weekly certifies the Whole to the Lord High-Treaſurer or Lords Commiſſioners, who immediately preſent the Ballance to the King. Twice a Year, viz. at Lady-Day and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas, he makes an Abſtract of all Accounts made in the preceeding Half-Year, whereof he delivers a Copy to the Lord Treaſurer, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to the Chancellour of the Exchequer.

                     <p>All <hi>Noblemen</hi> at their Creation have two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which ſignify two Duties.

                        <hi>Earl,</hi> by Cincture of Sword, a Mantle of State, with a Cap and Coronet put upon him by the King himſelf; and a Patent delivered into his hand. <hi>Viſcounts</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> are made by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and theſe ſometimes by Writ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are called to ſit in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Peers</hi> have Coronets, but with theſe Diſtinctions. A <hi>Baron</hi> has ſix Pearls upon the Circle; a <hi>Viſcount,</hi> the Circle of Pearls without number; an <hi>Earl</hi> has the Pearls raiſed upon Points, and Leaves low between; a <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> a Pearl and a Strawberry-leaf round, of equal height; and a <hi>Duke,</hi> Leaves without Pearls. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Dukes</hi> of the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> bear (like the Prince of Wales) a Coronet of Croſſes and Flower de Luce. Which is the ſame with the King's, excepting the Arches, Globe, and Croſs on the top of the King's Crown.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Diſtinction amongſt the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> is their Parliament Robes, in their ſeveral Gards on their Mantles, and ſhort Cloaks about their Shoulders. For a <hi>Baron</hi> has but two Gards, a <hi>Viſcount</hi> two and a half, an <hi>Earl</hi> three, a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> three and a half, and a <hi>Duke</hi> four.

                        <hi>Dukes</hi> were at firſt ſo called <hi>a ducendo,</hi> being anciently Generals and Leaders of Armies in time of War. <hi>Marqueſſes,</hi> from their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Marches, and Frontire-Countries. <hi>Earls,</hi> in Latine <hi>Comites,</hi> becauſe they had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Counties. <hi>Viſcounts,</hi> in Latine <hi>Vice-Comites,</hi> as being Aſſiſtants or Deputies in the Government of Counties. <hi>Barons,</hi> according to Bracton, <hi>quaſi Robur Belli;</hi> the ſafety of the King and People, in Time of War, depending
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49236:308"/>upon their Courage and Skill in Martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>Anciently a <hi>Duke</hi> was made ſo for Term of Life, then held by Lands and Fees; till Dukes came to be Titular and Hereditary. In thoſe Times likewiſe there was no Earl but had a County or Shire for his Earldom; who, for the ſupport of his State, had the third Peny out of the Sheriffs Court, iſſuing out of all Pleas of that County whereof he was Earl. Alſo, thoſe <hi>Barons</hi> only were accounted Peers of the Realm, that held of the King <hi>per integram Baroniam,</hi> which conſiſted of 13 Knights Fees, and one third part, that is of 400 Marks, each Knights Fee being 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> And whoever had ſo much was wont to be ſummoned to Parliament. But then 100 Marks was as much as 2000 pounds at this day, as may be gueſſed by comparing the Prices of Things. 'Tis true King Henry III, after he had with much ado ſuppreſſed his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, called by Writ unto Parliament only ſuch great Men as had continued loyal, or were like ſo to be. Which Example being followed by his Succeſſors, they only were accounted Peers of the Realm that were ſo called by the King's ſpecial Writ. Till <hi>Barons</hi> came to be made by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as well as by Writ; and at laſt moſt by Patent, which makes it hereditary.</p>
                     <p>But there are <hi>Barons</hi> in England, that have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>All <hi>Dukes, Marqueſſes,</hi> and <hi>Earls</hi> at this day have their reſpective Titles from ſome Shire, or part of a Shire, Town or City, Caſtle, Park, or Village.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Barons</hi> are ſo denominated from their chief Seat, or a Caſtle belonging to the Family. Which is not to be divided amongſt Daughters, if there be no Sons; but muſt deſcend to the eldeſt Daughter.</p>
                     <p>None of theſe Honours can be loſt but theſe two Ways. Either by want of Iſſue male, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where the Patent extends to Iſſue female, as ſometimes it does. Or elſe by ſome heinous Crime; and then it cannot be reſtored to the Bloud, but by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Duke</hi> has the Title of <hi>Grace</hi> given him; and the other <hi>Peers,</hi> that of <hi>Lordſhip</hi> on <hi>Honour.</hi> Accordingly we commonly give to theſe the Epithet of <hi>Right Honourable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All Dukes and Marqueſſes Sons, are called <hi>Lords</hi> by the Courteſy of England, and the Daughters <hi>Ladies.</hi> I ſay by the Courteſy of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; for the Law makes no ſuch Diſtinction, but looks upon all as Commoners that have no Right to ſit in the Houſe of Peers. Of an Earl none but the eldeſt Son is called <hi>Lord,</hi> though all the Daughters be <hi>Ladies.</hi> And, as for the Iſſue of Vicounts and Barons, none of their Sons is <hi>Lord,</hi> nor of the Daughters <hi>Lady.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Dukes eldeſt Son is called <hi>Lord Marqueſs;</hi> and the younger Sons by their Chriſten-names, with the Title of <hi>Lord</hi> prefixt, as <hi>Lord William, Lord Thomas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:49236:309"/>
                     <p>A Marqueſſes eldeſt Son is called Lord of a Place; and the younger Sons, as thoſe of a Duke, that is by their Chriſten-names with the Title of <hi>Lord</hi> prefixt, as <hi>Lord William, Lord Thomas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Earl's eldeſt Son is born as a Viſcount, and called Lord of a Place.</p>
                     <p>In point of Precedency, this is the Rule. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Princes of the Bloud, the firſt amongſt the Nobility are the <hi>Dukes,</hi> and theſe are thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Viz.

                     <p>The <hi>Nobility</hi> of England have at all times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed many conſiderable Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>Though neither Civil nor Common Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any Teſtimony to be valid but what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Oath, yet the Teſtimony of a Peer of England, given in upon his Honour, without any oath, is eſteemed valid. And, whereas the law allows any one of the Commonalty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for Treaſon or Felony to challenge 35 of his Jury without ſhewing Cauſe, and others by ſhewing Cauſe; a Peer of the Realm cannot challenge any of his Jury, or put any of them to their Oath, the Law preſuming that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peers of the Realm, and judging upon their Honour, cannot be guilty of Falſhood, Favour, or Malice.</p>
                     <p>In Criminal Cauſes a Peer cannot be tried but by a Jury of the Peers of the Realm; who are not, as other Juries, to be put to their Oath, but their Verdict given in upon their Honour ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth.</p>
                     <p>All Peers of the Realm being lookt upon as the King's conſtant Counſellors, their Perſons are at all Times priviledged from Arreſts, except in Criminal Caſes. Therefore a Peer cannot be Outlawed in any Civil Action, and no Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies againſt him. The only Way for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from a Peer is by Execution taken forth upon his Lands and Goods, and not by Attachment, or Impriſonment of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>So tender is the Law of the Honour, Credit, Reputation, and Perſons of Noblemen, that there is a Statute on purpoſe, called <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> to puniſh all ſuch as by falſe Reports <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They are exempted from all Attendance at Leets, or Sheriffs Turns, where others are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take the Oath of Allegiance. And, whereas, for the ſuppreſſing of Riots, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff may raiſe the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus;</hi> yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command any Peer of the Realm to attend that Service.</p>
                     <p>In Civil Cauſes, they are not to be Impanelled upon any Jury or Inqueſt <hi>de facto,</hi> though in a Matter between two Peers; and, if a Peer be returned upon any ſuch Jury, there lies a ſpecial Writ for his Diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>They are, upon no Caſe, to be bound to their good Behaviour, or put to ſwear they will not break the Peace; but only to promiſe it upon their Honour, which was ever counted ſo ſacred as upon no terms to be violated.</p>
                     <p>Every Peer of the Realm ſummoned to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may conſtitute, in his lawful abſence, a Proxy to Vote for him; which none of the Commons may do.

                     <p>The Nobles to bear up their Rank, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally great and plentiful Eſtates, ſome of them
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49236:311"/>beyond thoſe of ſeveral Princes beyond Sea. And, till the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. they lived with ſuitable ſplendour and Magniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; Keeping a plentiful Table, and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attendance, with ſeveral Officers; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in noble Exerciſes, and appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad according to their Rank and Quality. Honour and Integrity, Juſtice and Sobriety, Courage and Wiſdom, were Virtues they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in. A Lord's Houſe was then lookt upon as a well diſciplined Court, where Servants lived not only in Plenty, but in great Order, with the Opportunity of getting good Breeding, and the Proſpect of raiſing themſelves in the World by their Lords Bountifulneſs and innate Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. How far the Caſe is altered, 'tis but too plain. Yet it is hoped, a virtuous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Prince will bring back that Golden Age.</p>
                     <p>But there is an additional Honour, the moſt ancient <hi>Order of the Garter,</hi> wherein ſome of the chief of our Nobility have ever had a ſhare, ſince its firſt Inſtitution. The Founder of this Order was that warlike and potent Prince, King Edward III, who ſeveral times triumphed over France and Scotland. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> gives it a ſlight O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal; but his Grounds by his own Confeſſion, grew from the vulgar Opinion. Which is, that Edward III, having obtained many great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (King John of France, and David Bruce of Scotland being both his Priſoners, King Henry of Caſtille the Baſtard expulſed, and Don Pedro reſtored by Edward the Black Prince) did upon no weighty Occaſion firſt erect this Order, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1350. Who dancing with the Queen, and other Ladies of the Court, took up a <hi>Garter</hi> that hapned to fall from one of them. Whereat
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49236:312"/>ſome of the Lords ſmiling, the King ſaid, that e're it were long he would make that <hi>Garter</hi> to be of high Reputation, and ſhortly after inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Order. A very unlikely Thing, that ſo noble an Order ſhould be raiſed on ſo mean a Foundation.</p>
                     <p>Whereas, according to <hi>Cambden,</hi> and ſeveral others, the Inſtitution of this Order by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid King Edward was upon his good ſucceſs in a Skirmiſh, wherein the King's <hi>Garter</hi> was uſed for a Token. The Order firſt Inſtituted by the Name of the <hi>Order of S. George,</hi> the Patron of England, and of this Order in particular. And, becauſe the <hi>Garter</hi> was the only part of the whole Habit of the Order, made choice of at firſt to be conſtantly worn, it came in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time to be called the <hi>Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame conſiſts of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> (which is always the King of England) and 25 <hi>Companions,</hi> called <hi>Knights of the Garter;</hi> ſome of them Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of other Countries, and the reſt Noblemen of this Kingdom. And 'tis obſerved, that there have been of this Order, ſince the Inſtitution, no leſs than 8 Emperours, and 27 or 28 forein Kings, beſides many Sovereign Princes of a lower Rank.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Garter,</hi> to be daily worn upon the left Leg by the Companions of this Order, is a blue <hi>Garter</hi> deckt with Gold, Pearl, and precious Stones, and a Buckle of gold. They are not to be ſeen abroad without it, upon pain of paying two Crowns to any Officer of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who ſhall firſt claim it. Only upon a Journey a blue Ribbon may ſerve inſtead of it.</p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:49236:312"/>
                     <p>The Meaning of the <hi>Garter</hi> is, to put the Companions of the Order in mind, that, as by this Order they were joyned in a firm League of Amity and Concord, ſo by their <hi>Garter,</hi> as by a faſt Tie of Affection, they are obliged to love one another. Now, to prevent an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it, King Edward commanded theſe French Words to be fixt upon it, <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe,</hi> that is, Shame be to him that thinks evil of it. And it was done in France, becauſe England being then poſſeſſed of a great Part of France, the French Tongue was the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Language in the King of England's Court.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the <hi>Garter,</hi> the honourable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are to wear at Inſtallations and high Feaſts, a <hi>Surcoat,</hi> a <hi>Mantle,</hi> a high black <hi>Velvet Cap,</hi> a <hi>Collar</hi> of pure gold, with other ſtately and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Apparel. The <hi>Collar</hi> compoſed of Roſes enamelled Red, within a Garter enamelled Blue, with the uſual Motto in Letters of gold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each of theſe Garters a Knot with Taſſels of gold.</p>
                     <p>By an Order made April 1626, they are to wear on the left ſide of their Upper Garment (whether Cloak or Coat) an <hi>Eſcutcheon of the Arms of S. George,</hi> that is, the Croſs of England incirled with the Garter and Motto, from whence round about are caſt Beams of Silver, like the Rays of the Sun in full luſtre, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Star.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Order belongs a <hi>Colledge,</hi> ſeated in the Caſtle of Windſor, with <hi>S. George's Chappel</hi> there erected by King Edward, and the <hi>Chapter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</hi> The <hi>Colledge,</hi> being a Corporation, has a great Seal, and ſeveral Officers belonging to it.</p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:49236:313"/>
                     <p>The principal of theſe is the <hi>Prelate of the Garter,</hi> which Office is ſettled on the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Wincheſter. Next, the <hi>Chanceliour of the Garter,</hi> the Biſhop of Salisbury for the time being. A <hi>Regiſter,</hi> the Dean of Windſor. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the principal King at Arms, who manages and marſhals their Solemnities at their Inſtalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Feaſts. And laſtly, the <hi>Uſher of the Garter,</hi> who is alſo the Uſher of the Black-Rod.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Chappel</hi> there belongs 14 <hi>Secular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and 13 Vicars, all Prieſts. Beſides 26 <hi>poor Knights,</hi> maintained by this Colledge, for their Prayers to the Honour of God, and S. George.</p>
                     <p>The Solemnity of this Order is performed yearly on S. <hi>George's Day,</hi> the 23th of April. As for the Orders and Conſtitutions belonging to this Society, touching the Solemnities in making theſe Knights, their Duties after Creation, and their high Priviledges, they are too long to be inſerted here.</p>

                     <p>The Degree of <hi>Baronets</hi> is the next to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and the only Degree of Knighthood that is Hereditary. An Honour firſt Inſtituted by King James I, Anno 1611, conferred by a Patent upon a Man, and his Heirs Males of his Body lawfully begotten.

Therefore they have the Priviledge to bear in a Canton of their Coat of Arms, or in a whole Scutcheon, the Arms of <hi>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49236:314"/>groſs near the King's Standard. And for their Funerals they have alſo particular Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                     <p>The whole Number of them, by the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; is not to exceed 200 at one and the ſame time. After which Number compleated, as any one for want of Heirs come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, the Number is not to be made up by new Creations, but be ſuffered to diminiſh, as appears by their Patent. And yet the very Founder, King James I, tranſgreſſed the firſt his Rule, by creating 203. Charles, his next Succeſſor, made 455. But King Charles II, outdid them both, by creating near upon 900 during his Reign. At this time there are reckoned above 700 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir Nicholas Bacon</hi> of Suffolk was the firſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet</hi> created, whoſe Succeſſor is therefore ſtiled <hi>Primus Baronettorum Angliae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Honour is ever to be created between Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Baronets.</p>
                     <p>As for the other two Degrees of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> they are but Perſonal, and not Hereditary; ſo that the Honour dies with the Perſon Knighted, and deſcends not to his Son.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Knights of the Bath</hi> are ſo called, from their Bathing the Night before the Creation within the Liſts of the Bath. The firſt of this ſort were made by Henry IV; but now they are uſually made at the Coronation of a King or Queen, or Creation of a Prince of Wales.</p>
                     <p>They wear a Scarlet Ribbon Belt-wiſe; and take place of Knights Batchelours, but come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baronets. There are but a few Knights of this Order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Knights Batchelours</hi> are the loweſt ſort of Knights, and the moſt common. Anciently this Degree was in greater eſteem than it is at the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49236:314"/>preſent, when it was only conferred upon Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for their military Service, who from the Gilt Spurs uſually put upon them were called in Latine <hi>Equites Aurati.</hi> Whereas now a days this Honour is alſo beſtowed upon Gown-men, viz. Lawyers and Phyſicians. And all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony uſed in their Creation is their Kneeling down before the King, and His Majeſties lightly touching them on the ſhoulder with a naked Sword.</p>
                     <p>Anciently there was another Sort of Knights now diſuſed, I mean the <hi>Knights Bannerets,</hi> who were Knighted in the Field. This Order was accounted very honourable, had the precedency of the Knights of the Bath, and bore their Arms with Supporters, which was not allowed to any under this Degree.</p>
                     <p>Next to Knights are the <hi>Eſquires,</hi> ſo called from the French <hi>Eſcuyer,</hi> this from the Latine <hi>Scutiger;</hi> which Name was given of old to him that attended a Knight in time of War, and carried his Shield. Whereas Eſquire with us is a meer Title of Dignity next to and below a Knight, and ſignifies a Gentleman, or one that beareth Arms as a Teſtimony of his Nobility and Gentry.</p>
                     <p>They who by right claim this Title now are all the younger Sons of Noblemen; and, by the Common Law of England, their very eldeſt Sons are Eſquires, and no more. Next are the Eſquires of the King's Body, the eldeſt Sons of Noblemens younger Sons, Knights eldeſt Sons, and their elder Sons for ever. Next, Eſquires created by the King, by putting about their Necks a Collar of S's, and beſtowing on them a pair of Silver Spurs.</p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:49236:315"/>
                     <p>Thoſe that are reputed, or lookt upon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to Eſquires, tho none of them be really ſo, are ſeveral Magiſtrates, and Officers in the King's Court; as Judges, Sergeants at Law, Sheriffs, Mayors, Juſtices of the Peace, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors at Law, and the principal Commanders of an Army. So Heads of Houſes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, Doctors of Law, Phyſick, and Muſick, uſually take place next to Knights, and before ordinary Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are properly ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of a good Family, bearing a Coat of Arms, without any particular Title. And theſe we call Gentlemen born.</p>
                     <p>But Uſe has ſo far ſtretched the ſignification of this Word, both high and low, that every Nobleman, nay the King himſelf, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Gentleman. And, on the other ſide, any one that, without a Coat of Arms, has either a liberal, or genteel Education, that looks Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like (whether he be ſo, or not) and has wherewithall to live freely and handſomely, is by the Courteſy of England uſually called a Gentleman. Others, by their Offices, are lookt upon as ſuch; particularly moſt of the King's Menial Servants, and the principal Officers in Noble-mens Families, &amp;c. The Military Profeſſion, which has been always counted Noble, ſeems to give the very meaneſt Profeſſors of it a Title to this Quality. But it is more particularly adapted to two diſtinct Bodies of the King's Guards; the one called <hi>Gentlemen Penſioners,</hi> who gard his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within Doors; and the other the <hi>Gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n of the Guard,</hi> by whom is meant his Body of Horſe Guards, who gard the Kings Perſon on horſeback without Doors.</p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:49236:315"/>
                     <p>As in Germany all Noblemens, ſo in England all Gentlemens Arms deſcend to all the Sons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Only the eldeſt Son bears Arms without difference, which the younger may not.</p>
                     <p>Beſides above 700 Knights Baronets, and the few Knights of the Bath, there are reckoned to this day above 1400 ordinary Knights, and 6000 Eſquires and Gentlemen; whoſe younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in all may make up at leaſt 12000 all over England. And the Land in the Poſſeſſion of them all has been computed to amount at leaſt to four Millions yearly.</p>
                     <p>The Law of England, which is ſo Favourable to the Nobility, has not a proportionable Regard for the Gentry. For, whether they be Knights, Eſquires, or Gentlemen, they are all reckoned by law, even Noblemens Sons, amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England. So that the eldeſt Son of a Duke, though by the Courteſy of England ſtiled an Earl, ſhall be Arraigned (if charged with a Crime) by the Title of Eſquire only, and tried by a Jury of Common Free-holders. In Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can ſit only in the Houſe of Commons, if elected, unleſs he be called by the King's Writ to the Houſe of Lords.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Knights</hi> are diſtinguiſhed in England by the Title of <hi>Sir</hi> prefixt to their Chriſten names. And Gentlemen have no other Title but that of <hi>Maſter</hi> when ſpoken of; and that of <hi>Sir,</hi> when ſpoken to. But, if one writes to an Eſquire, the Direction ought to be thus, as <hi>To Thomas Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field Eſquire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Epithet of <hi>Honourable</hi> is uſually given to any Knight, Eſquire, or Gentleman, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome eminent and perſonal Worth.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the Commonalty I mean Yeomen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Artificers, Tradeſmen, Mariners, and all others getting their Livelyhood after a Mechanick Way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yeomen</hi> are ſuch amongſt the Commonalty who having Land of their own to a good value, Keep it in their own hands, husband it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and live with their Families upon it. They are therefore by the Law called <hi>Freeholders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold Lands or Tenements Inheritable by a perpetual Right to them and their Heirs for ever. Their Number is great in England, and many of them have Eſtates fit for Gentlemen. Forty or Fifty pounds a Year is ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>And, whereas Husbandry is commonly lookt upon as the moſt innocent Life, and the freeſt from the Corruption and Cheats that attend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Profeſſions, therefore the Law of England has a better Opinion of the Yeomanry that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy Lands, than of Tradeſmen or Artificers. And accordingly Yeomen are capable of bearing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49236:316"/>ſome Offices, as of Conſtable, and Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to ſerve upon Juries, to be Train-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to vote in the Election of Knights of the Shire to ſerve in Parliament, &amp;c. And, by the Statutes of England, certain Immunities are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Freeholders and Land-men, tho they are not Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>Next to Freeholders are the <hi>Copy-holders,</hi> who are much of the ſame nature. I mean thoſe <hi>Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> that hold Copy-holds certain. Which is a kind of Inheritance, in many Places called <hi>Cuſtomary;</hi> becauſe the Tenant dying, and the Hold being void, the next of Bloud, paying the Cuſtomary Fine (as two Shillings for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, or ſuch like) may not be denied his Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They are called <hi>Copy-holders,</hi> from the Copy of Court-Roll of the Mannor within which they hold their Land, by which Copy only they hold it. For this is all a <hi>Copy-holder</hi> has to ſhew for his Title, which he takes from the Steward of the Lord of the Mannor's Court.</p>
                     <p>But, as England is one of the moſt trading Countries in Europe, ſo the greateſt Body of its Commonalty is that of <hi>Traders,</hi> or Men that live by Buying and Selling.</p>
                     <p>The moſt eminent whereof are thoſe we call <hi>Merchants,</hi> who trade only by Whole-ſale. Theſe are the Men who, by their Stock and Induſtry, have found the Way, not only to Inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to make the whole Nation thrive and flouriſh by a perpetual Circulation of Trade, by exporting home-bred and importing forein Commodities, by incouraging thereby Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by procuring comfortable Imployment to a vaſt Number of Artificers, Tradeſmen, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In ſhort, ſuch is the benign Influence of Trade and Commerce by their means all over the Nation, that there is ſcarce any part of it but feels the Benefit thereof. And for this great Advantage to the Publick, as well as their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Wealth, they have got a proportionable eſteem and reſpect from the reſt of the Nation. Inſomuch that, whereas Trading formerly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a Gentleman ignoble, now an ignoble Perſon makes himſelf by Merchandizing as good as a Gentleman; and many Gentlemen Born (ſome of them Younger Sons of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) take upon them this Profeſſion, without any prejudice or blemiſh to their Birth. Nay, the Law of England, that ever had but a ſlight Opinion of Traders, is ſo far Obliterated in this Point by Cuſtom and Intereſt, that, whereas by Law a Ward come to Age may bring his Action of Diſparagement againſt his Gardian for offering any ſuch in Marriage, now 'tis common for Gentlemens and Merchants Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Intermarry.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, Gentility with competent Means is an excellent Compound; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, 'tis but a wretched Condition, as the World goes now. And who would not rather be a ſubſtantial honeſt Trader, ſo as to ſtand upon his own Legs, and make ſome figure in the World, than for want of Imployment to ſtarve with a point of Honour, or live a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Life; in this Age eſpecially, where Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is ſo little pitied, and grown ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible?</p>
                     <p>Poverty (ſays an Author) the general Scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow of Mankind, the fear of which keeps Men in perpetual Morion, and makes them run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the greateſt Dangers.</p>

                     <q>Per Mare Pauperiem fugiunt, per Saxa, per Ignes.</q>
                     <p>Poverty, a lingering kind of Death, that, having once ſeized upon ones Spirits, dejects and ſtupifies him, takes away the edge of his Senſes, weakens his Memory, diſcompoſes his Mind, and makes him almoſt uncapable of any Thing. Poverty, in a Word, that turns Men into ridicule, as <hi>Juvenal</hi> has it in theſe Words,
<q>
                           <l>—Nil habet Paupertas durius in ſe,</l>
                           <l>Quam quod Ridiculos homines facit—</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In France indeed, where if a Gentleman born betakes himſelf to Trade forfeits his Gentility, the Gentry ſtand ſo much upon their Honour, that it is very rare to ſee a French Gentleman turn to Merchandizing. But there they have greater Opportunities for preferring themſelves according to their quality, eſpecially by the Way of Arms. And ſo jealous is the whole Body of them of this their Gentility, that rather than have it expoſed in any of their Members by naked and hungry Poverty, their Way is to help one another to the utmoſt of their Power, and (which is very commendable) they ſeldom fail to give a Gentleman, though never ſo needy, the Reſpect due to his Birth. But it is ſomething ſurprizing, they ſhould ſo much decline Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, their King <hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> not to mention his other Commodities, being the greateſt Salt-Merchant in the Known World,</p>

                     <p>But, to return to our <hi>Commonalty,</hi> it may be ſaid to comprehend three Parts in four of the Nation, the Generality of them Imployed in Husbandry, Trade, and Navigation, ſome in a higher, others in a leſſer Degree. And ſuch is the Happineſs of this People in general, that none injoy greater Priviledges, or are more ſecure by Law from Oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>They are ſubject to no Taxes or Laws, but what they contrive themſelves by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in Parliament. And, in point of Trials, none of them can be Tried but by a Jury of his Peers, that is, by Twelve Men Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners like himſelf. Nor can he be Condemned but by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Government is ſo very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Common People of England, that unleſs the Laws be invaded, (which are the Bulwark of the Government) they need not fear to be any Way oppreſſed.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Clergy of England is, like the Laity, divided into ſeveral Ranks, or Degrees. For as the Laity conſiſts of Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty; ſo the Clergy is divided into Biſhops, Dignitaries, and Inferious Clergy.</p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:49236:318"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Biſhops</hi> are thoſe who take upon them the Government of the Church of England, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, every one in his Dioceſe. And, as England conſiſts of 26 Dioceſes, or Biſhopricks, ſo there are accordingly 26 Biſhops, or Dioceſans. Beſides the Biſhoprick of the Iſle of Man, which is a diſtinct Biſhoprick.</p>
                     <p>Their Office being <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> their Buſineſs is to feed their Flocks with the wholſom Doctrine of the Church, and ſo to overſee the Inferiour Clergy that by their Lives and Doctrine the People may Keep the Truth, and live according to the Rules of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>And, as each of them has a Canonical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all the Prieſts of his Dioceſe, ſo they have all in chief the <hi>Power of Ordination;</hi> Which however is never performed but by the Biſhop joyntly with ſome other Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>They are alſo Impowred to grant Inſtitutions to Benefices upon Preſentations of other Patrons, to command Induction to be given, to order the collecting and preſerving of the Profits of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Benefices for the Succeſſors Uſe.</p>
                     <p>They are bound to defend the Church-Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and once in three Years to Viſit each his Dioceſe. In this triennial Viſitation they Inquire of the Manners, Carriages, and Offences of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Church-Wardens, and the reſt of the Pariſhioners, principally of Offenders againſt Juſtice, Piety, and Sobriety. Wardens of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, Phyſicians, Chirurgeons, Schoolmaſters, and Midwives fall particularly under the Care of their Viſitation.</p>
                     <p>Of the foreſaid 26 Biſhops, there are two called <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> the one of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other of <hi>York.</hi> Theſe have a Superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over all the Church of England, and in ſome meaſure over the other Biſhops.</p>

                     <p>The Biſhop of Wincheſter was anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and ſo ſtiled by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VIII, in the Statutes of the Honourable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Garter. But that Earldom was ſoon after diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>The Manner of making a Biſhop in England is ſo ſolemn, that it is not to be pretermitted. When a Biſhops See becomes vacant, firſt the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral give notice of it to the King, as the Patron of all the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks in England; and humbly requeſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that He will give them Leave to chuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Whereupon the King grants them his <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> that is, Leave to elect; and withal does uſually recommend unto them whom His Majeſty thinks fit. Then the Dean ſummons a Chapter, that is, the Prebendaries of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral; who either elect the Perſon recommended by the Kings Letters, or ſhew Cauſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Election being over, it is certified to the Party elected. Who does modeſtly refuſe it the firſt and ſecond time; if a third time, the ſame is certified to the King, who recommends another. When the Election is accepted, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the King, and the Archbiſhop of that Province. The King thereupon gives his Royal Aſſent under the Great Seal of England, which is exhibited to the Archbiſhop of that Province, with Command to confirm and conſecrate him. Then the Archbiſhop ſubſcribes <hi>Fiat Confirmatio,</hi> and gives. Commiſſion under his Epiſcopal Seal to his Vicar General, to perform all the Acts thereunto required.</p>
                     <p>Then a Citation comes forth from the ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car General in the Name of the Archbiſhop, ſummoning all the People that have any Thing to object againſt the Party elected to appear at a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49236:320"/>certain Time and Place, to make their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Which is done firſt by Proclamation three ſeveral times, at Bow-Church; and then the Citation is affixt on the Church door for all people to read. At the Day and Place aſſigned for the Oppoſers Appearance, the Vicar General ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as Judge, the Proctor for the Dean and Chapter exhibits the Royal Aſſent, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Archbiſhop. Which being read and accepted by the Vicar General, the Proctor exhibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chapter, preſents the Biſhop elect, returns the Citation, and deſires the Oppoſers to be called in three times. This being done accordingly, and none appearing, they are pronounced Contumacious; and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, in the behalf of the Biſhop elect. Who thereupon takes the Oaths of Supremacy, Simony, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience; and then the Judge of the Arches reads and ſubſcribes the Sentence. After which there is uſually an Entertainment made for the Officers and other there preſent. And the Biſhop elect, being thus Confirmed, may act as Biſhop, even before he is Conſecrated.</p>
                     <p>Some time after this follows the Conſecration. For the Biſhops are a diſtinct Order of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there being three Orders in the Church of England, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons. And, as none may be admitted a Deacon (without a Diſpenſation) under the Age of 23 Years, nor a Prieſt under 24; ſo none can be made a Biſhop, till he be full 30 Years of age. And, whereas Prieſts and Deacons, when they take their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Orders, are ſaid to be Ordained; a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, when he takes the Epiſcopal Order, is ſaid to be Conſecrated.</p>
                     <p>The Conſecration is performed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of the Province, or ſome other Biſhop
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49236:320"/>Commiſſioned by him, with the Aſſiſtance of two other Biſhops, either in the Chappel of the Archbiſhop, or of any other Biſhop. And it is done either upon a Sunday or Holy-day, after Morning-Service. Then the Archbiſhop (or his Deputy) begins the Communion-Service. And, after a certain Prayer appointed for this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, one of the Biſhops preſent reads the Epiſtle 1 Tim. 3, another the Goſpel John 21. Which is followed by the Nicene Creed, and next to that a Sermon. After Sermon, the Biſhop elect, being veſted with his Rochet or Linnen-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by two Biſhops preſented to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, or his Deputy, ſitting in his Chair; who demands the King's Mandate for the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cauſes it to be read. That done, the Biſhop elect takes the Oath of Supremacy, and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbiſhop. After which, they fall to Prayers. Then the Biſhop elect does Anſwer ſeveral Interrogatories that are put to him; and, after his Anſwers, the reſt of the Epiſcopal Habit is put upon him. This done, they Kneel down to Prayers again. Which being ended, the Biſhop elect being upon his Knees, the Archbiſhop and Biſhops there preſent lay their Hands on his Head, and by a pious grave Form of Words they Conſecrate him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Archbiſhop delivers a Bible to the Biſhop elect, with another ſet Form of Words. Then they all proceed to the Communion; and having received the Sacrament, they depart with the Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Then the new Biſhop treats at a ſpelendid Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the chief of the Nobility, Clergy, Judges, Privy Counſellours, &amp;c. Which Dinner (with the Fees of Conſecration) does uſually amount to five or ſix hundred Pounds.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Suffragan Biſhops had the Name, Title, and Dignity of Biſhop, and (as other Biſhops) were Conſecrated by the Archbiſhop of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.

                     <p>I come now to the Prerogatives, Priviledges, Bower, Revenues, and great Deeds of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
                     <p>All the Biſhops of England are Barons and Peers of the Realm, and ſit as ſuch in the Houſe of Lords.

                     <p>Beſides the Priviledges injoy'd by Biſhops, as Peers, and therefore common with thoſe of the Temporal Lords, they have ſome peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and thoſe of a high nature. 'Tis unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Whereas no Temporal Lord is in Law acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſuch out of the Prince's Dominions who conferred his Honour.</p>
                     <p>The Law of England attributes ſo much to the Word of a Biſhop, that, not only in the Trial of Baſtardy, the Biſhops Certificate ſhall ſuffice, but alſo in Trial of Hereſy, which toucheth a Mans Life.</p>
                     <p>If a Clergy-man Kills his Biſhops or Ordinary, the Law looks upon it as a Parricide; and 'tis Petty-Treaſon, by Law.</p>
                     <p>Every Biſhop may by Statute Law qualify ſix Chaplains, which is as many as a Duke.</p>

                     <p>In former Reigns, when the Clergy were judged to be the fitteſt Perſons to execute moſt of the chief Offices and Places of the Realm, ſuch Benefits and Advantages accrued thereby to this Kingdom, that there are few Things of any great Conſequence to the Welfare thereof but the Biſhops and Prelates were the chief Actors therein. The excellent <hi>Laws</hi> (ſays an Author) made by ſeveral of the Saxon Kings, from whom we have our Common Laws, and our Priviledges mentioned in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> were all made by the Perſuaſions and Advice of Biſhops, named in our Hiſtories. And 'twas a Biſhop of London, at whoſe Requeſt William the Conqueror granted to this City ſo large <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> that, in a grateful Remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen did, before the late dreadful Fire, upon ſome ſolemn Days of their Reſort to S.

The <hi>Union</hi> of the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (whereby a long and cruel Civil War was ended) was by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel of Biſhop Morton, then a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Counſellour.

                     <p>AS amongſt the Laity the Gentry Keeps a middle Rank betwixt the Nobility and the Commonalty, ſo amongſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of England there is a middle Station between the Epiſcopal Order and the inferiour Clergy. Which Station is properly that of the <hi>Dignify'd Clergy,</hi> as <hi>Deans, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> the Subject of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>For a Supply of able and fit Perſons to make Biſhops, or to aſſiſt Biſhops, a certain Number of eminent Divines both for their Piety and Learning were thought fit by our Fore-fathers to be placed in a Collegiate manner at every Cathedral, or Epiſcopal See; out of which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries fit Perſons from time to time might be choſen to govern the Church. Who, living here in a Society together, have the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of getting Experience, of reading Men, and raiſing themſelves by degrees above their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Familiarity with the inferiour Country
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49236:325"/>Clergy. Whereby they fit themſelves for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Authority in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly in every Cathedral Church in England there is a certain Number of <hi>Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> and a <hi>Dean</hi> over them; moſt of them with a plentiful Maintenance, but ſo that the Dean has commonly a double Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deans</hi> of the old Foundations, which were before the Suppreſſion of Monaſteries, are brought to their Dignities much like Biſhops. The King firſt ſends forth his <hi>Conge d'eſlire</hi> to the Chapter, who thereupon proceed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. To their Election the King grants his Royal Aſſent; then the Biſhop confirms the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty elected, and gives his Eſpiſcopal Mandate to Inſtal him. Whereas the Deans of the new Foundations (upon Suppreſſion of Abbeys or Priories transformed by Henry VIII, into Dean and Chapter) are Inſtalled a much ſhorter way, by virtue of the King's Letters Patents, without either Election or Confirmation.</p>
                     <p>In the Cathedral Churches of <hi>S. David,</hi> and of <hi>Landaff,</hi> in Wales, there never has been any Dean. But the Biſhop in either is Head of the Chapter; and, in the Biſhops abſence, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>S. Davids,</hi> and at <hi>Landaff</hi> the Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</p>
                     <p>'Tis obſervable beſides, that there are ſome Deans in England without any Juriſdiction, but only for Honour ſo called; as the Dean of the Chappel Royal, the Dean of S. George's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at Windſor, the Deans of Rippon and Garnſey, and all the Deans created by Henry VIII.</p>
                     <p>Some Deans there are without any Chapter, that injoy however certain Juriſdictions; as the Deans of Croydon, Battel, and Bocking.</p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:49236:326"/>
                     <p>A <hi>Prebendary</hi> is ſo called (as ſome will have it) <hi>a praebendo Auxilium aut Conſilium Epiſcope vel Decano,</hi> from giving Help or Counſel to the Biſhop or Dean. Or (as others) from the Word <hi>Prebend,</hi> which ſignifies the Portion which every Member or Canon of a Cathedral Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives for his Maintenance out of the common Stock of the Church. Of which Prebends ſome are <hi>Simple,</hi> or have no more but the Revenue towards their Maintenance; and others <hi>with Dignity,</hi> ſuch as have Juriſdiction annexed to them, according to the divers Orders of Churches.</p>
                     <p>Now among the Prebendaries (or Canons) of the old Foundations, ſome are <hi>Canonici actu,</hi> ſuch as have Right to vote in the Chapter. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Canonici in Herba,</hi> that have a Stall in the Quire, but no Vote in the Chapter; only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving right to the next Prebend that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come void.</p>
                     <p>The Dean and Prebendaries ought to reſide in their reſpective Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, to frequent publick divine Service, to preach by turns upon Sundays and all feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Days, and at due time to adminiſter the Lord's Supper. They ought to inſtruct the weakeſt ſort of the Country Clergy, to direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may beſt profit their Auditors. In ſhort, they ought to ſhew good Example to the Inferiour Clergy. And, when ſummoned by the Biſhop, they are to aſſiſt him in ſome of his Epiſcopal Functions; as Ordinations, Deprivations <hi>ab Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> Condemnation of obſtinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, &amp;c. Upon the King's Writ of <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> they elect the Biſhop of that Dioceſe.</p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:49236:326"/>
                     <p>The chief of the Prebendaries is the <hi>Sub-Dean,</hi> who ſupplies the Deans part in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arch-Deacons</hi> are ſo called for their Charge over the Deacons, who are in every Dioceſe to be guided and directed under the Biſhop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Arch Deacon, though a Presbyter himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There are of theſe 60 in all England, each Dioceſe having in it one or more Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conries, for Diſpatch of Eccleſiaſtical Buſineſs, Their Office is to Viſit two Years in three, the third Year being the Biſhops Viſitation Year. Then the Arch-Deacon is to inquire of Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Movables belonging to the Churches under his Juriſdiction, to reform Abuſes in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Matters, and to bring the more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affairs before the Biſhop of the Dioceſe. Therefore he is called <hi>alter Epiſcopi Oculus,</hi> the other being the Dean. He is alſo, upon the Biſhops Mandate, to Induct Clerks into their Benefices, and thereby to give them Poſſeſſion of all the Profits thereunto belonging.</p>
                     <p>Many Arch-Deacons have, by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Courts and Officials, as Biſhops have.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there are <hi>Rural Deans,</hi> anciently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Archipresbyteri, &amp; Decani Chriſtianitatis,</hi> perhaps becauſe they had the Overſight of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Prieſts. Now their Office is, upon the Biſhops Orders, to convocate the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to ſignify unto them (ſometimes by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) the Biſhops Pleaſure, and to give Induction in the Arch-Deacons place, when he lives far off.</p>

                     <p>BY the Inferiour Clergy I mean the <hi>Pariſh Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> The firſt vulgarly called <hi>Parſons,</hi> are either <hi>Rectors,</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars.</hi> The Prieſt of every Pariſh is called <hi>Rector,</hi> unleſs the Praedial Tythes be Impropriated; and then he has the Title of <hi>Vicar, quaſi vice fungens Rectoris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, as I ſaid before page 236, there are three Orders in the Church of England, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons. That of Deacons is the firſt ſtep into the Service of the Church, and ſeems only miniſterial to the Prieſtly Office. For the Charge of Deacons is to take care of the Poor, baptize, read in the Church, aſſiſt the Prieſt at the Lord's Supper, by giving the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only. And this is properly to fit and prepare him for the Prieſtly Office.</p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:49236:327"/>
                     <p>None may be admitted a Deacon before the Age of 23 Years, without a Diſpenſation; nor may a Deacon be admitted into the Prieſtly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without a Diſpenſation, till he has ſerved as Deacon the ſpace of one Year.</p>
                     <p>The Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons is performed four times in the Year, upon four ſeveral Sundays in the Ember Weeks. Which, by the Laws of the Church, is a Time of Prayer and Faſting for the whole Nation, that ſo by their joynt Prayers they may recommend to God all that are to receive Ordination. Thoſe are the Weeks called <hi>Quatuor Tempora</hi> by the ancient Fathers, and of great Antiquity in the Church. The proper Days for this Devotion are the <hi>Wedneſday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> next after Quadrageſima Sunday, after Holy-Rood Day in September, and S. Lucies Day in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</p>
                     <p>The Ordination is performed in a moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, grave, and devout manner, by a Biſhop, aſſiſted with ſome of the Dignified Clergy, or others in Prieſtly Order. I begin with that of Deacons, which is thus</p>
                     <p>Firſt, after Morning Prayer, there is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon about the Duty and Office of Deacons and Prieſts. The Sermon ended, thoſe that ſtand for Deacons being decently habited are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Biſhop by the Arch-Deacon, or his Deputy. Whom the Biſhop asks, if he has made due Inquiry of them; and then asks the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they Know any notable Impediment or Crime in any of them. Then follow certain godly Prayers, with the Collect, and Epiſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this Solemnity. After which, the Oath of Supremacy is adminiſtred to every one of them; and the Biſhop puts divers godly Queſtions to them. Which being anſwered,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49236:328"/>they all Kneel; and he laying his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſeverally does Ordain them Deacons. Then he delivers to every one of them the New Teſtament, and gives them Authority to read the ſame in the Church. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Biſhop appoints one of them to read the Goſpel. This done, they with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop proceed to the Communion; and ſo are diſmiſſed with the Bleſſing pronounced by the Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>The Ordination of Prieſts is much after the ſame manner. Only the Epiſtle and Goſpel are different; and, after the Queſtions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers made, the Biſhop puts up a particular Prayer for them. Which being ended, he deſires the Congregation to recommend them to God ſecretly in their Prayers; for doing of which there is a competent time of general Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Then follows <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> in Meter to be ſung. And, after another Prayer, they all Kneeling, the Biſhop, with one or two of the grave Prieſts there preſent, lays his Hands upon the Head of every one of them ſeverally, and ſo gives them Ordination in a grave ſet Form of Words, different both from that of Biſhops, and that of Deacons. The reſt is the ſame as in the Ordaining of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
                     <p>What the Office of a Pariſh-Prieſt is, is ſo well known, that I need not inſiſt upon it. His Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he has from the Biſhop, but the Benefice he holds from the Patron. Now we call thoſe <hi>Patrons of Churches,</hi> who by firſt building of Churches, or firſt indowing them with I ands, have obtained for them and their Heirs a Right of Advowſon or Patronage. Who, when the Church is void, is to propoſe a fit Clerk to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49236:328"/>the Biſhop, to be by him Canonically Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Revenues</hi> of the Inferiour Clergy, they are (as in all Places) unequally divided. So that ſome Parſons have a very plentiful, ſome but a competent, and others but a ſmall Maintenance; ſome two or three hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> or more, others one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or thereabouts, and ſome much ſhort of that. Which, beſides the Glebe-Land, is moſtly raiſed by way of Tythes, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties paid for Chriſtenings, Marriages, and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
                     <p>The Plurality of Benefices, that is, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of holding more Livings than one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Church of England for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of worthy and eminent Divines, makes room for many <hi>Curates.</hi> So we call thoſe who officiate in thoſe Churches, where ſuch as hold Plurality of Livings do not Keep their Reſidence. Theſe <hi>Curates</hi> are ſuch Clergy-men as they think fit to appoint in their places, with ſuch an Allowance as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The Condition of <hi>Vicars</hi> is much the ſame as that of Curates, if not worſe. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly officiate in thoſe Livings which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Impropriations,</hi> of which there are in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land no leſs than 3845. For above a third part of the beſt Benefices of England, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by the Popes Grant appropriated to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries towards their Maintenance, were upon the Diſſolution of the Monaſteries made Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees. Which Benefices ever ſince have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly provided, not with the beſt Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, nor with the beſt of the Clergy.</p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:49236:329"/>
                     <p>Amongſt the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Clergy, this is one of the principal, that all Deans, Arch-Deacons, Prebendaries, Rectors, and Vicars may, ſome by themſelves, others by Proxy or by Repreſentative, ſit and vote (as Commons Spiritual) in the Lower Houſe of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>No Subſidies, or other Tax to the King, might formerly be laid upon them, without their own Conſent firſt had in Convocation. And indeed the Clergy paying to the King the firſt Fruits, that is, the firſt Years Profits of all Spiritual Benefices, and yearly the Tenth of all the ſaid Benefices, 'twas thought but reaſonable they ſhould be exempted from all other Taxes. Though, to give the Laity good Example, they have often laid upon themſelves Subſidies, and other great Taxes.</p>
                     <p>The Glebe-Lands, and Spiritual Revenues of Clergy-men, being held <hi>in pura &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua Eleemoſyna,</hi> that is (as the Law calls it) in <hi>Frankalmoine,</hi> are exempted from arraying and Muſtering of Men, or Horſes for the War. And, as by their Function they are prohibited to wear any Arms, therefore they cannot ſerve perſonally in War. But they ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try otherwiſe, by being our Leaders in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Warfare.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any Clergy-man be compelled to undergo any other Perſonal Functions, or Services in the Common-wealth. For, if any Man, by reaſon of his Land, be liable to be elected to any Servile Office, if he takes Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he is free, and there lies a Writ purpoſely to free him.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49236:329"/>
                     <p>Clergy-Men are not obliged to appear at Sheriffs Turns, or Courts-Leet, there to take their Oath of Allegiance.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> no Clergy-man ought to he Fined or Amerced according to his Spiritual Means, but according to his Temporal Eſtate, and to the Crime committed.</p>
                     <p>The Goods of Clergy-men are diſcharged, by the Common Law of England, from Tolls and Cuſtoms of Average, Pontage, Murage, and Panage; for which they have the King's Writ to diſcharge them, provided they don't trade with them.</p>
                     <p>All Clergy-men are free from the King's Purveyors, Carriages, Poſt, &amp;c. for which they may demand a Protection from the King, with the Clauſe <hi>Nolumus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the whole <hi>Number of the Clergy</hi> in England, beſides the two Archbiſhops, and the twenty four Biſhops, there are 26 Deans of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, 576 Prebendaries, 9653 Rectors and Vicars; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides as many more Curates and others in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders.</p>
                     <p>In point of Learning and good exemplary Life, England (I dare ſay) is outdone by no Clergy in the Chriſtian World. If, amongſt the Inferiour Clergy there be ſome ignorant lewd Livers, the dignified Clergy, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Colledge, are generally Men noted both for their great Piety and deep Learning. And the late Scuffle they had with the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in ſo difficult a Juncture as King James his Reign, as it has ſufficiently ſhewn the greatneſs of their Parts and the Depth of their Learning, ſo it expreſſed to the World their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49236:330"/>ſtrong and invincible Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and the groſs Miſtake of Diſſenters that lookt upon them as broad-faced Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
                     <p>Nothing troubles me more, than to ſee ſome of the Clergy ſo much infatuated as to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defeat (as far as in them lies) the late ſignal Providence, that reſcued us ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from Popery and Slavery. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon thoſe who remain quiet under their Scruples of Conſcience, and are not ſo far diſturbed in their Mind as to diſturb the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But to ſee ſome ſo low-ſpirited as to fall a hugging their old Enemies the French, and admire them as their Tutelar Angels who were but 'tother Day the greateſt Object of their Scorn and Contempt, this affords matter of admiration. 'Tis pretty to ſee the Temper of theſe Men, and thoſe they have infected, all made up of Contradictions. They hate their Friends, and love their Enemies. They deride Popery, and yet do their utmoſt to bring it in. None more averſe than they from Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but leave no Stone unturned to work it into theſe Kingdoms. Whoſe Condition is like that of a Sick Perſon, that longs for Health, and yet is greedy to catch at any Thing that pleaſes his Fancy, let it prove never ſo fatal. The Truth is, 'tis nothing elſe in the bottom but a malignant Humour, that cauſes Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſtrikes up to the Brain; lately a catching, but now (thanks be to God) a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>I conclude with the <hi>Pariſh-Church Officers,</hi> which are indeed Lay-men; but, as they have a peculiar Relation to the Church, they may be counted to be half-Clergy-men.</p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:49236:330"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> amongſt theſe, are the principal. Whoſe Office is to ſee, that the Church be in good Repair, and want nothing for Divine Service, &amp;c. That the Church-yard be well incloſed, and an exact Terrier of the Glebe-Land be Kept. They are alſo to ſue for any Thing Kept from the Church, that is of right belonging to it; to inquire after, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and preſent to the Biſhop ſcandalous Livers, and to collect the Charity of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners. The Biſhops Orders they are both to declare, and to execute.</p>
                     <p>They ſerve commonly two Years in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Eaſter-Week is the time for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Uſually they are elected by the Parſon and the Pariſhioners, where it is ſo agreed. If not, the Parſon chuſes one, and the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the other.</p>
                     <p>In ſome great Pariſhes there are joyned <hi>Sideſmen</hi> to the Church-Wardens, to aſſiſt them in the Inquiries into the Lives of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Livers, and in preſenting Offenders at Viſitations.</p>
                     <p>Next is the <hi>Clerk,</hi> whoſe Office is to ſerve at Church the Prieſt and Church-Wardens. He ought to be at leaſt 20 Years old, and a Man of good Life and Converſation, that can read, write, and ſing Pſalms, the tuning whereof is part of his Office. He is commonly choſen by the Parſon only.</p>
                     <p>In many Pariſhes there is alſo one <hi>Sexton,</hi> or more. So we call thoſe that attend the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners at Church, and let them into their Pews. Which in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches is commonly performed by the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> ſo called from a Silver Verge which they carry in their hands.</p>

                     <p>To take care of the Pariſh-Concerns, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, a great Power is by Law committed to the <hi>Veſtry-men;</hi> So called from the Veſtry, a Room adjoyning to the Church for the Uſe of the Parſon and Pariſh-Officers. They are a ſelect Number of the chief Pariſhioners in every Pariſh within the City of London and Suburbs, and elſewhere; who yearly chuſe Officers for the Pariſh, as <hi>Church-Wardens, Conſtables, Scavengers, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors for the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Beadle's</hi> is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Office.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ALL Women in England are either <hi>Noble,</hi> or <hi>Ignoble.</hi> The firſt are ſo by <hi>Deſcent, Creation,</hi> or <hi>Marriage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Deſcent,</hi> as when a Lady holds an Eſtate by a noble Title. For Titles of Honour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for want of Males, do deſcend to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. But only to one of them, becauſe they are Things in their own nature intire, and not to be divided amongſt many, as the Lands and Tenements are, which deſcend in equal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Daughters. By <hi>Creation,</hi> ſome Women have been made, at the King's pleaſure, Baroneſſes, Counteſſes, and Dutcheſſes.</p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:49236:331"/>
                     <p>But the greateſt Part of the Engliſh Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women are ſo only by <hi>Marriage,</hi> all Women being counted Noble that are married to any Peer of the Realm. And ſo (as the Law ſays) <hi>Uxor fulget Radiis Mariti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet, if afterwards they marry to Men not No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they loſe by Law their former Dignity, and follow their latter Husbands Condition; though by the Courteſy of England, they are ſtill lookt upon and reſpected as Noble, and called by the Name of the former Husband. But Women, Noble by Deſcent or Birth-right, or by Creation, retain by Law their Nobility, tho they Marry afterwards to Husbands under their Degree.</p>
                     <p>'Tis obſervable, that any Noble-woman by Birth, being married to a Baron, takes place but as Baroneſs, though ſhe be a Duke's Daughter. But, if ſhe marry to one under the Degree of a Nobleman, as to a Knight or Gentleman, the Courteſy of England gives her place according to her Birth, and not her Husbands Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>A Noble-woman marrying to an Ignoble Man adds no Honour to him. Her Honour is all hers, and he has no ſhare in it, though by Marriage he becomes Maſter of all her Goods and Chattels. But her Dignities with the Lands, deſcend to her next Heir.</p>
                     <p>Noble-women, in the Eye of the Law, are Peers of the Realm; and accordingly they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy moſt of the Priviledges of Peers. But it is thought, they cannot maintain an Action upon the Statute <hi>De Scandalo Magnatum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As happy as the Condition of married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is generally all over England, yet the Laws of this Kingdom are in the main very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49236:332"/>upon them. For, when a Woman marries, ſhe gives her ſelf over, and what ſhe brings with her, to the power of her Husband. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe is poſſeſſed of, the Husband becomes the Proprietor of it; and her very neceſſary Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is not hers in Propriety. If ſhe has any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, it is all <hi>in Capite,</hi> that is, ſhe holds it of, and by her Husband, who is the Head of his Wife. And all the Chattels perſonal ſhe had at the Marriage are ſo much her Husbands, that, he dying before her, they ſhall not return to his Wife, but go with his other Goods and Chattels to the Husband's Executor or Adminiſtrator. Except the <hi>Paraphernalia,</hi> that is, thoſe Goods which a Wife, beſides her Dower or Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is after her Husbands Death allowed to have, as Furniture for her Chamber, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apparel, and Jewels if ſhe be of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which are not to be put into her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Inventory, eſpecially in the Province of York.</p>
                     <p>The Wife can make no Contract without her Husband's Conſent; and without it ſhe cannot ſet, ſell, give away, or alienate any Thing.</p>
                     <p>So great is her Subjection to her Husband's Will, that, in the Senſe of the Law, ſhe has no Will of her own. Therefore, when a Man and his Wife commit a Felony together, the Wife can neither be Principal, nor Acceſſory; the Law ſuppoſing ſhe was forced thereunto, in regard of the Subjection and Obedience ſhe ows to her Husband.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, by the Law of England, a Wife is ſo much in the Power of her Husband, that ſhe is no better than a Child, or the beſt of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. For ſhe can call nothing her own, more
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49236:332"/>than a Child, whom his Father ſuffers to call many Things his own, yet can diſpoſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And, when ſhe offends, 'tis in her Husband's Power to correct her, as a Servant. Therefore, if ſhe wrong another by her Tongue, on by Treſpaſs, her Husband muſt anſwer for her Fault, and make Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>But a Woman, upon Marriage, does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe the Power over her Perſon, Will and Goods; but ſhe muſt part with her very Name, and ever after uſe her Husband's Surname, contrary to the Cuſtom of ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>One Thing more there is yet which eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the great Subjection of a Wife to her Husband. And that is the Puniſhment inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Woman that has Killed her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which is to be Burnt alive; the Offence being counted Petty-Treaſon by Law, that is, as great a Crime as the Killing of his Father, or Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Yet in ſome things the Law is very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the female Sex of England. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a Wife bring forth a Child begotten before Marriage by another Man than her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Husband, her Husband is bound to own the Child, and that Child ſhall be his Heir at Law. So literally we take the Saying, <hi>Pater eſt quem Nuptiae demonſtrant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Husband be a long time abſent from his Wife, though it be for ſome Years, and his Wife bring forth a Child during his Abſence, he muſt father that Child, in caſe he lived all the while in this Iſland, or (to ſpeak the Words of the Law) <hi>inter quatuor Maria.</hi> And, if that Child be her firſt-born Son, and her Husband's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49236:333"/>Intailed, or left without Will, that Child ſhall be Heir to it.</p>
                     <p>Another Priviledge of Engliſh-Women is, that the Wife having no Joynture ſettled before Marriage, may challenge, after her Husband's Death, the third part of his yearly Rents of Land during her Life; and within the City of London, a third Part of all her Husband's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables for ever. If there be many Children, the reſt comes to the eldeſt; if not, to the next Heir at Law. And, if ſhe do not approve of the Diviſion, ſhe may claim the Right of being Indowed with the beſt of the Land, to a third part.</p>
                     <p>But, if the Law be ſo favourable in ſome Caſes to married Women, Cuſtom, or rather the good Nature of Engliſhmen, makes their Condition much happier. Whoſe Reſpect and Tenderneſs for them is generally ſo great, that every where they give 'em the Precedency, and put them the leaſt of any Nation upon Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and Hardſhip. Women are not here mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as in Italy and Spain; and that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Paſſion of Jealouſy has got ſo little footing here, that the Nation is little troubled with its troubleſom Influences, or fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. In ſhort, married Women have here more Liberty, than any where elſe. Their chief Care is of the Houſe and Houſhold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient Cuſtom of the Greek Wives; which is indeed the proper Office of a Wife, as the Husband's is to mind his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns abroad.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch is generally their Carriage to their Husbands, and their mutual Tenderneſs for them, that, where the Law gives them nothing, the dying Husband often leaves all behind him to the Diſpoſal of his Wife. Except in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49236:333"/>where a peculiar Order is taken by the City agreeable to the Civil Law.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of Children, and Servants.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom the Condition of Women in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I come now to that of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi> As to the firſt, a Father in England has a more abſolute Authority over his Children, than is uſual in our Neighbour Countries. Here a Father may give all his Eſtate Unintailed from his Children, and all to one Child; the Conſideration whereof is apt to keep his Children in aw, and within the bounds of filial Obedience.</p>
                     <p>But commonly the eldeſt Son inherits all Lands, and the younger Children Goods and Chattels, by which is meant the Perſonal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Among the Nobility and Gentry, the eldeſt Son's Wife's Portion does uſually go for the Portions of his Siſters; and the younger Sons are put out to ſome Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon why the eldeſt Son is ſo well provided beyond the reſt of the Children is, that he may be the better able to bear up the Honour of the Family, which in courſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alls to the ſhare of the Eldeſt. For, when all is done, Titular Honour without Means, is commonly lookt upon but as an empty Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:49236:335"/>
                     <p>But, if there be no Son, the Lands, as well as Goods, are equally divided among the Daughters.</p>
                     <p>A Son at the Age of 14, his Father being dead, may chuſe his Gardian, and may claim his Land holden in Socage, that is, ſuch Lands as Tenants hold by, or for certain inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Services of Husbandry to be performed to the Lord of the Fee. He is free to conſent to Marriage, and may by Will diſpoſe of Goods and Chattels.</p>
                     <p>At the Age of 15, he ought to be Sworn to his Allegiance to the King; at 21 he is ſaid to be of full Age. Then he is free to make any Contracts, and to paſs by Will both Goods and Lands; which in other Countries may not be done till the Age of 25, called <hi>Annus Conſiſtentiae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Daughter at the Age of 7 Years, may conſent to Marriage; but at 12, ſhe is free to retract or confirm it. If ſhe confirms it, then the Marriage is good, and ſhe may make a Will of Goods and Chattels.</p>
                     <p>At 21 ſhe may Contract, or Alienate her Lands by Will, or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Servants</hi> in England are either tied to a certain Number of Years, or only by the Year; theſe being free to quit their Service at ſuch a Warning as is agreed upon between the Maſter (or the Miſtris) and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                     <p>By thoſe that are tied to a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years, I mean <hi>Apprentices,</hi> the uſual Time for their Apprentiſhip being 7 Years. This is the moſt Servile Condition in England,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49236:335"/>conſidering the Laſh they ly under, together with their long and ſtrict Confinement, under Articles. And, whereas other Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Wages for their Service, theſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do pay a Sum of Mony to their Maſters for their Prenticeſhip.</p>
                     <p>The Condition of other <hi>Servants</hi> is much eaſier all over England. For, beſides that few undergo the Hardſhip that Prentices do, they may be free at the Years end, giving 3 Months Warning; and, if a Servant do not like one Maſter, he may go to another, where perhaps he may find more favour or advantage. But, before a Perſon ventures upon ſuch a Servant, 'tis civil firſt to get his former Maſters Leave, and prudential to have from him a teſtimony of his faithfulneſs and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                     <p>Now there are ſo many Degrees of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ants</hi> in England, that if ſome live meanly, there are others who live genteely, and ſome of theſe ſo ſplendidly as to keep Servants of their own. In great Families where a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of quality makes a proper Figure, and has a ſutable Attendance, there is a neceſſary Subordination of Servants; ſo that the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Servants may be at the beck of their Superiour Officers, to anſwer the ſeveral parts of their reſpective Duties. Thus a great Man lives like a Prince, and Keeps a Court of his own.</p>
                     <p>In general it may be ſaid, no Country is more favourable than England to Servants; who generally live here with more eaſe and leſs Subjection, and have larger Salaries than any where elſe.</p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:49236:336"/>
                     <p>The truth is, if we conſider the nature of a Servant, how by going to Service he deveſts himſelf of what is deareſt to Mankind, his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Subjects his Will to another, who ſometimes proves magget-headed, cruel, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, I think it but reaſonable, to have a tender Regard for good Servants. For this, amongſt other Things, was that great Man of Spain, Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> ſo noted in his time; who proved ſo bountiful and ſo generous a Maſter to his Servants, that Hiſtory to this day does admire him for it.</p>
                     <p>As for ſtubborn and unruly Servants, the Law of England gives Maſters and Miſtreſſes Power to correct them; and Reſiſtance in a Servant is puniſhed with ſevere Penalty. But for a Servant to Kill his Maſter or Miſtris is ſo high a Crime, that it is counted Petty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a Crime next to High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>Since Chriſtianity prevailed here, England admits of no forein <hi>Slaves.</hi> In forein Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions indeed, the Engliſh, as other Nations, buy and ſell Negro's as Slaves. But a forein Slave brought over into England is, upon Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> free from Slavery, though not from ordinary Service.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true there has been a ſort of Tenure here, called a Tenure in <hi>Villenage,</hi> and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Villain,</hi> who was in effect a Bond-man to the Lord of the Land. For the Lord might take Redemption of him to marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make him free. He might put him out of his Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, at his Will; and might beat and chaſtiſe, but not maim him. Now ſuch <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi> are out of date, though the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them ſtands unrepealed to this day.

                     <p>THE <hi>High Court of Parliament</hi> being the Great Council of England, the Supreme Court of Judicature, and One of the moſt Auguſt Aſſemblies the World, is the Court that I am to ſpeak in the firſt place.</p>

                     <p>It came to be called <hi>Parliament</hi> from the French <hi>Parlement,</hi> and this from their Verb <hi>Parler</hi> to ſpeak (or talk) together. The ſame is taken in a two-fold Senſe. Firſt, as it includes the Legiſlative Power of England, as when we ſay an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> In which Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it includes the King, Lords, and Commons; each of which have a Negative Voice in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, ſo that without their joynt Conſent no Law can by either abrogated, or made. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in a Vulgar Senſe; as when we ſay <hi>the King and Parliament,</hi> or the <hi>King has called a Parliament,</hi> by which is meant the Two Houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Houſe of Lords and the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>This Court is a Body Corporate, conſiſting (according to the firſt Acceptation of the Word) of the Three Eſtates of the Realm. And though the Name <hi>Parliament,</hi> by which it is now called, be not probably older than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by William Duke of Normandy; yet 'tis made plain by ancient Records and Precedents, that the former Kings of England, even in the Saxons-time, had from time to time great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Councils, much of the ſame nature as our Parliaments. In the Saxons Time, ſays <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> the great Council of the Nation conſiſted of the King, Lords, and Commons.

                     <p>The Power of Convening (or Calling) a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is ſolely in the King. But, if the King be under Age, or not <hi>Compos Mentis,</hi> or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent out of the Realm upon ſome Expedition, 'tis lodged in the Protector or Regent, who then ſummons the Parliament, but ſtill in the King's Name.</p>
                     <p>The Summons ought to be at leaſt 40 Days before the Day appointed for the Meeting; and it is done by Writ in Law-Latin, expreſſing that it is with the Advice of the Privy Council. Which Writ is a kind of ſhort Letter directed and ſent by the Lord Chancellour (or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Chancery) to every Lord Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, to appear at a certain Time and Place, to treat and give their Advice in ſome important Affairs concerning the Church and State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, as for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Writs are ſent to all the Sheriffs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to ſummon the People to elect two Knights for each County, two Citizens for each City, and one or two Burgeſſes for each Borough, according to Statute, Charter, or Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>And, whereas there are ſome Cities and Towns that are Counties of themſelves, or that have each within it ſelf the Priviledge of a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49236:340"/>County, the Writ is directed to them as it is to Sheriffs of other Counties.</p>
                     <p>At every County, after the Delivery of the Parliament Writ to the Sheriffs, Proclamation is made in the full County of the Day and Place appointed for the Parliament to ſit, and for all Freeholders to attend ſuch a Time and Place for the Election of the Knights for that County. But the Sheriff ought to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Time for the Day of Election, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Warning to thoſe that have Voices, that they may be preſent. Otherwiſe the Election is not good, if, for want of due Notice, part of the Electors be abſent.</p>
                     <p>Now, by an Act in the Reign of Henry VI, it was Ordained, that none ſhould have any Suffrage in the Election of the Knights of the Shire, but ſuch as were Freeholders, did reſide in the County, and had a yearly Revenue, at leaſt to the Value of 40 Shillings; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſcovery of the Gold and Silver in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, was as much as 30 <abbr>l.</abbr> now. And the Sheriff has Power by the ſaid Act to examine upon Oath every ſuch Chuſer, how much he may expend by the Year, if he doubt the value of it.</p>
                     <p>If any Man keep a Houſhold in one County, and remain in Service with another Family in another County, yet he may be at the Chuſing of Knights of the Shire where he Keeps his Family; for it ſhall be ſaid in Law a Dwelling in that County.</p>
                     <p>The Election ought to be in full County be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 8 and 9 of the Clock, according to Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. And no Election (ſays the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) can be made of any Knight of the Shire but between 8 and 11 of the Clock in the Forenoon. But, if the Election be begun within the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49236:340"/>Time, and cannot be determined within thoſe Hours, the Election may be proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Before Election can be made, or Voices gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Precept directed to the Sheriff ought to be read and publiſhed. And, if the Party or Freeholders demand the Poll, the Sheriff ought not to deny the Scrutiny, for he cannot diſcern who be Freeholders by the View. In ſhort, of ſo many as ſtand for Competitors, the two that have moſt Voices are declared to be duly elected for the inſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Plurality of Voices does likewiſe carry it for Citizens that ſtand for Cities, and Burgeſſes for Boroughs. Where in ſome Places none but Freeholders have a Right of Election, in others all Houſholders have a ſhare in it. And, though no Alien can be a Parliament Man; yet, if he be a Houſholder, his Voice is good, as in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Members for the City of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter.</p>
                     <p>A Burgeſs elected for two ſeveral Boroughs, as it ſometimes happens, muſt wave one Election when he comes to the Houſe, and chuſe for which Place of the two he will ſerve; ſo as a Writ may iſſue for a new Election, that the Number may be full.)</p>
                     <p>All Elections ought to be freely and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently made, notwithſtanding any Prayer or Command to the contrary. Or elſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not, as it ſhould be, free. 'Tis true the Elections can never be ſo free, as not to be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Temptations of private Intereſt, or the Influence of Feaſting, two unavoidable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Yet it does not follow but that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be called Free, when the Court has no hand in the Elections by ſuch unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49236:341"/>Methods as were uſed in the late Reign, by Cloſetting, by fair Promiſes, and foul Threats.</p>
                     <p>The Returns concerning the Parties choſen are made in the Crown-Office, by the Sheriffs, Mayors, or Bayliffs, whom the Writs were ſent to, and to whom it belongs to manage the Elections.</p>
                     <p>Upon a falſe Return, which happens but too frequently, the Sheriff who made the Return is liable to the Forfeiture of 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> to the King, and 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> more to the Party injured, and to be Impriſoned for a Year without Bail or Mainprize And every Mayor or Magiſtrate of a Town ſo offending, is to pay 40 <abbr>l.</abbr> to the King, and as much to the Party. This Action to be within 3 Months after the Parliament commenced by the Party injured, or by any other Man who will.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Party returned remains a Member of the Houſe, till his Election be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For denying the Poll when required, alſo for adviſing and abetting the ſame, the guilty Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been adjudged by the Houſe to ſtand Committed to the Sergeant during Pleaſure, to pay all due Fees, to defray the Charge of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to be Aſſeſſed by four of the Committee, to acknowledge his Offence upon his Knees at the Bar, and read a Submiſſion. This was the Caſe of <hi>Thomſon</hi> Sheriff of York, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettor Alderman <hi>Henlow,</hi> in the Reign of Charles I.</p>
                     <p>The Perſons to be Elected as the fitteſt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the true Intereſt of the Nation, ought to be Sober, Underſtanding, Well-principled, and Well-affected to the eſtabliſh'd Government by Law. If Men of Eſtates, it is ſo much the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49236:341"/>better, ſuch Men being ſuppoſed to be leſs Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. But this is left to the Peoples Choice.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that by Law ſuch as ſtand for Knights of the Shire ought to be Knights, Eſquires, or Gentlemen fit to be made Knights.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute none ought to be choſen a Burgeſs of a Town in which he do's not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit. But the Uſage of Parliament diſpenſes with that Act.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any be legally choſen that is not of full Age, that is, 21 Years old at leaſt. And reaſon good, for, if no Man under that Age can diſpoſe of his Eſtate, much leſs ſhould he have any ſhare in the ſupream Power of the Nation, to judge, vote, or diſpoſe of the Eſtate of the Realm. Yet the Practice in the Houſe of Commons has often been otherwiſe; in the Houſe of Lords, but ſeldom.</p>
                     <p>Whoever ſtands to be Elected muſt be a Native Engliſhman, or at leaſt muſt be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized by Act of Parliament. No Alien Denizated ought to ſit here.</p>
                     <p>None of the Judges can be choſen, that ſit in the Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, becauſe they are Aſſiſtants in the Lords Houſe, But any that have Judicial Places in other Courts Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, being no Lords of Parliament, are Eligible.</p>
                     <p>No Sheriff, nor Clergy-man can be choſen a Member of Parliament. Not the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his perſonal Attendance is required with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Bayliwick, during the time of his Sheriffalty. Nor the laſt, becauſe he is of another Body, viz. the Convocation; and the Clergy of the Convocation-Houſe are no Part or Member of the Parliament.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49236:342"/>
                     <p>A Man attainted of Treaſon or Felony, &amp;c. is not Eligible. For he ought to be <hi>magis ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, tho the Common Law do's diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Party; yet the Priviledge of the Houſe being urged prevails over the Law.</p>
                     <p>Anciently the Elected Members had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Allowance from the reſpective County, City, or Borough, for which they ſerved in Parliament. A Knight of the Shire was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed 4 ſhill. and a Citizen or Burgeſs 2 ſhill. a Day; which in thoſe Days was a conſiderable Sum. But then the Seſſions were but ſhort, ſometimes but eight Days, ſometimes leſs, ſeldom above three or four Weeks; and yet during that ſhort ſpace of time ſeveral great and weighty Affairs were diſpatched. Which (as ſome think) were prepared to their hand by the King and Council, as it is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in Sweden by the 40 Counſellors of State, and in Scotland by the Lords of the Articles. And, if they did only debate upon ſuch Things as the King did propoſe, a little Time might ſerve well enough to do it. But it do's not appear to be ſo by what paſſed Feb. 9. 1597, 39 Eliz. When the Queen gave her Royal Aſſent to 24 publick and 19 private Bills; but refuſed 48 Bills more, which had paſſed both Houſes. Certain it is, that there was leſs Canvaſſing, and more Plainneſs in thoſe Days, than there is at preſent.</p>
                     <p>The Place of Meeting for this honourable Aſſembly is in whatſoever City, Town, or Houſe the King pleaſes. But of latter times it has been ufually at the Kings ancient Palace at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49236:342"/>
                        <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> the Lords in a Room by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Commons not far from them, in another Room, which formerly was S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens Chappel.</p>
                     <p>When the Day prefixt by the King in his Writs of Summons is come, His Majeſty uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes in perſon to the Houſe of Lords, cloathed with his Royal Robes, the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, and the Sword of State before Him. At the upper end of the Room is placed a Chair of State under a Canopy, upon which His Majeſty ſits.</p>
                     <p>Then all the Temporal Peers appear in their Scarlet Robes, every one according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and the Spiritual Lords, in their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Habit, which they do all the Seſſions.</p>
                     <p>On the Kings right hand, next the Wall, are placed on a Form the two <hi>Arch-Biſhops;</hi> next below, on another Form, the Biſhops of <hi>London, Durham,</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> then, upon other Forms on the ſame ſide, all the reſt of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſit, according to the priority of their Conſecration.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chancellor, or Keeper (when there is one) ſtands behind the Cloth of State, or fits on the firſt Wool-ſack, before the Chair of State, with his Great Seal and Mace by him.</p>
                     <p>On the Kings left hand are placed the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, Preſident of the Council, and Lord Privy Seal, of they be Barons, above all Dukes, but thoſe of the Royal Family; if not Barons, then they ſit uppermoſt on the Wool-ſacks. And on the ſame ſide ſit the <hi>Dukes, Marqueſſes,</hi> or <hi>Earls,</hi> according to their Creation. Croſs the Houſe, below the Wool-ſacks, the firſt Form is that which the <hi>Viſcounts</hi> ſit upon; and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next Forms, the <hi>Barons,</hi> all in order.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49236:343"/>
                     <p>The King being thus ſeated in his Throne, with this noble Appearance of the Peers of the Realm, all ſtanding uncovered, his Majeſty ſends for the Commons from their Room where they are aſſembled. Who being come (at leaſt part of them) ſtand at the Bar of the Lords Houſe. Whereupon the King makes a ſhort Speech to both Houſes, concerning ſuch Matters as He thinks fit to lay before them for the Good of the Kingdom. Amongſt which that of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Mony is moſt commonly one, in order to anſwer the extraordinary Charges of the Crown.</p>
                     <p>The King having ended his Speech, the Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) did formerly uſe by the Kings Appointment to inlarge upon it, with all the Rhetorick and Logick the Matter could bear, to diſpoſe both Houſes to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the King. But His preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has declined that Method, and being a Prince of few Words gains more upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men by his conciſe and plain Way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, (as the more agreeable to a true gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature) than perhaps he might with all the Windings and Turnings of artificial Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</p>
                     <p>Then the Speaker of the Houſe of Lords commands, in the Kings Name, the Commons to aſſemble in their Houſe, there to chuſe one of their Members for their Speaker, and to preſent him ſuch a Day to His Majeſty. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the King withdraws, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preſently re-aſſemble themſelves in the Lower Houſe, in order to chuſe one of their Members for Speaker.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, as in the laſt Seſſion, the Speaker is choſen by the Kings Command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49236:343"/>fore His Majeſty delivers his Speech to both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>After the Speaker is choſen, and the Choice approved by the King, His Majeſty leaves both Houſes to their private Debates upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Speech; and do's no more appear amongſt them that Seſſion in his Royal Robes, except upon the paſſing of any Act, or at the Cloſe of the Seſſion, whether it be by Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Prorogation, or Diſſolution. 'Tis true, upon any extraordinary Debate in the Houſe of Lords, 'tis cuſtomary with the Kings of England to aſſiſt at the ſame; not to argue upon it, or to influence the Houſe one way or other, but only to hear the Arguments of the Houſe upon the Matter in Debate. But then the King appears without his Crown and Robes, and every Peer ſits (except when he ſpeaks to the Houſe) as if the King were not there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> or the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe,</hi> conſiſts of 189 Members. Viz. 163 Temporal Lords, whereof 14 <hi>Dukes,</hi> 3 <hi>Marqueſſes,</hi> 72 <hi>Earls,</hi> 9 <hi>Viſcounts,</hi> 65 <hi>Barons;</hi> and 26 Spiritual Lords, whereof 2 <hi>Arch-biſhops,</hi> and 24 <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the King may, by virtue of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, increaſe the Number of the Peers to ſit and vote in their Houſe, as Barons, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Writs for that pupoſe to whomſoever His Majeſty thinks fit for that Service.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper (when there is one) is of courſe the Speaker of this Houſe. Otherwiſe they may appoint any of their own Members, or elſe one of the Judges, for that Place; as in the Caſe of their late Speaker, the Right Honourable the Marquis of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49236:344"/>
                        <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and that of Sir Robert <hi>Atkins,</hi> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the preſent Speaker of the Houſe of Lords.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the firſt Wool-ſack, which is the uſual Seat for the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, there are other Wool-ſacks; Upon which the <hi>Judges,</hi> the Kings <hi>Council at Law,</hi> and the <hi>Maſters of Chancery</hi> (not being Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons) ſit, not to give their Suffrage, but only their Advice, when required thereto. The Uſe of which <hi>Wool-ſacks</hi> is probably to put them in mind of the great Advantages the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Wool has brought to this Nation, ſo that it may never be neglected.</p>
                     <p>On the lowermoſt Wool ſack are placed the <hi>Clerk of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Clerk of the Parliament;</hi> The firſt being concerned in all Writs of and Pardons in Parliament, and the other in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Records of all Things paſſed therein. Under this there are two <hi>Clerks,</hi> who kneeling behind the Wool-ſack write upon it.</p>
                     <p>Without the Bar of the Houſe ſits the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> ſo called from a black Stick he carries in his hand, who is (as it were) the Meſſenger of this Houſe. For he is imploy'd, amongſt other Things, to call for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Houſe of Lords upon His Majeſties Command; and to his Cuſtody are Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all ſuch Peers as the Houſe things fit to Commit upon any Treſpaſs. Under him is a <hi>Yeoman <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> that waits at the Door within, a <hi>Crier</hi> without, and a <hi>Sergeant at Mace</hi> always attending the Speaker.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Lower houſe,</hi> is by much the greater Body of the two. For, as England conſiſts of 40 Counties, in which there are 25 Cities, 8 Cinque-Ports,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49236:344"/>
2 Univerſities, and 168 Borough-Towns, all which are Priviledged to ſend Members to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ament, if we reckon two Members from each, the Whole amounts to 486 Members. To which adding 24 from Wales, the Whole is 510.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, there are three Boroughs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, each of which ſends but one Member; viz. <hi>Abington</hi> in Oxfordſhire, <hi>Higham-Ferrers</hi> in Northamptonſhire, and <hi>Bewdley</hi> in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire. But theſe three, wanting of the Number, are made up by the City of <hi>London,</hi> which ſends four Members; and by the City of <hi>Bath,</hi> which ſends three.</p>
                     <p>Of all this great Number, many are uſually abſent, upon Buſineſs, or Sickneſs, &amp;c. So that, if they be three hundred met together, 'tis counted a pretty full Houſe. And, if they be but forty Members in all, they make a houſe.</p>
                     <p>This Houſe, repreſenting the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Realm, do's generally conſiſt of the Flower of the Gentry; ſome of them Noblemens Sons, Privy Counſellors, Courtiers, Men learned in the Law, Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Merchants, &amp;c. but moſt of them Gentlemen of good Eſtates, with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a liberal and genteel Education. This is an aggregate Body from all Parts of the Nation, whoſe Learning and Eloquence, Wit and Policy ſtrive to outdo each other. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49236:345"/>the Clerk of the Houſe ſitting near him at the Table. But none wears a Robe but the Speaker, except (as I hinted before) the Members of Parliament for the City of London, who at their firſt Meeting appear in their Scarlet Robes. Every Member wears what he fancies moſt, and ſo do the Temporal Lords in their Houſe, on all Days when the King comes not thither in State. To Strangers, I confeſs, it looks ſomething odd, that ſo auguſt an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, veſted with a Legiſlative Power, and met together for the Exerciſe of the ſame, ſhould have no proper Garb for ſo great a Council, but appear in their uſual Dreſs. But Cuſtom has ſo far prevailed againſt the Inconveniencies that attend thoſe Formalities, (which the Engliſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry are generally averſe from) that they are not like to be ever ballanced by the Reſpect and Veneration that might be gained, as in forein Countries, by the ſmall trouble of them.</p>
                     <p>The uſual Time for the Meeting of each Houſe is in the Forenoon, from eight or nine a clock till twelve or one; except Sundays, high Feſtivals, and Faſt-Days.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, my next Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to ſpeak about the Choice of the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the Houſe of Commons; Who is the Mouth of the Houſe, and ſo neceſſary a Part thereof, that they can do no Buſineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. For 'tis the Speakers Part to ſee the Orders of the Houſe obſerved, to ſtate the Bills that are brought in, to collect the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Debates, and the Senſe of the Houſe upon them.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49236:345"/>
                     <p>The fitſt Day each Member is called by his Name, every one anſwering for what Place he ſerveth. That done, a Motion is made to chuſe their Speaker; who ought to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Ability, and is uſually one of the long Robe. And, to avoid all Delays, the Choice is commonly ſuch as the King approves of.</p>
                     <p>This Choice is made by the Plurality of Votes. Upon which the Party choſen deſires (according to ancient Cuſtom) to be excuſed from ſo weighty an Office, and prays the Houſe to proceed to a new Election. But he is commonly anſwered with a full Conſent of Voices upon his Name. And then two of the principal Members go to him, and lead him from his Place to the Speakers Chair; where being ſet, they return to their Places.</p>
                     <p>Then the Speaker riſes, and makes a ſhort Speech to the Houſe, conſiſting of his humble Thanks for their good Opinion of him, with Promiſes of his beſt Indeavours for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>At the Day appointed for his Preſentation to the King (which is uſually the next Day) His Majeſty being come to the Houſe of Lords in his Royal Robes, and the Lords alſo in their Robes, the Commons are called in. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the <hi>Speaker</hi> is brought between two of them, with low Obeyſance to the Bar, and ſo preſented at the Bar to His Majeſty; where he makes likewiſe a modeſt Refuſal. But the King approving the Commons Choice, and not allowing of his Excuſe, the <hi>Speaker</hi> nakes an Oration to His Majeſty; the Matter whereof is left to his own Thoughts, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o Direction about it from the Commons. But it uſually ends with theſe three Petitions.

                     <p>As they are beſt acquainted with the State of the Nation, and the publick Grievances, theſe often do take place. If any Laws are fit to be Abrogated, and new ones Made, this is a proper Subject for them to go upon. And, whilſt they mind the Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis to be ſuppoſed they mind that of the King.</p>
                     <p>In order to which, any Member of the Houſe may offer a <hi>Bill</hi> for the publick Good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And he that tenders the Bill muſt firſt open the Matter of it to the Houſe, and offer the Reaſons for admitting thereof; upon which the Houſe will either admit, or deny it.</p>
                     <p>But, if any member deſire, that an Act made, and in force, may be Repealed or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, he is firſt to move the Houſe in it, and have their Reſolution, before any Bill to that purpoſe may be offered. If the Houſe ſhall think it fit, upon the Reaſons alledged, their uſual Way is to appoint one or more of the Members to bring in a Bill for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>A private Bill, that concerns any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is not to be offered to the Houſe, till the Leave of the Houſe be deſired, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch Bill made Known, either by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Petition.</p>
                     <p>Petitions are uſually preſcribed by Members of the ſame County the Petitioners are of.

                     <p>The preferring of Bills, either to be Read or Paſſed, ly's much in the Speaker's Power. For, though he be earneſtly preſſed by the Houſe for the Reading of ſome one Bill; yet, if he have not had convenient time to Read the ſame over, and to make a Breviate thereof for his own Memory, he may claim a Priviledge to defer the Reading thereof to ſome other time. Formerly the Speaker had liberty to call for a trivate Bill, to be Read every Morning.</p>
                     <p>The Clerk of the Houſe is uſually directed by the Speaker, and ſometimes by the Houſe, what Bill to read, who with a loud and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Voice firſt reads the Title of the Bill; and, after a little Pawſe, the Bill it ſelf. Which done, Kiſſing his hand, he delivers the ſame to the Speaker. Then the Speaker ſtands up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, whereas otherwiſe he ſits with his Hat on; and holding the Bill in his hand ſays, <hi>This Bill is thus Intituled,</hi> and then reads the Title. Whereupon he opens to the Houſe the ſubſtance of the Bill; which he does, either by truſting to his Memory, or with the help of a Breviate, filed to the Bill.</p>
                     <p>The effect of the Bill being thus opened, he declares to the Houſe, <hi>that it is the firſt Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bill,</hi> and delivers it again to the Clerk. For every Bill is to be Read three times, before it can be made an Act. Except a Bill of Indemnity coming from the King, which has but one Reading in each Houſe, becauſe the Subject ought to take it as the King will give it. The ſame it is with a Bill of Subſidies granted by the Clergy.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt Read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> of the Bill 'tis not uſual with the Houſe to ſpeak to it, or put it to the Queſtion; but rather to take time till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reading, in order to conſider of it in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49236:348"/>mean while. Nor to move for any Addition to it, which were to imply, that the Body of the Bill is good, before it comes to a regular Trial upon the Second Reading.</p>
                     <p>But, if any Bill originally begun in the Lower Houſe happen, upon the firſt Reading to be debated to and fro, and that upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Houſe do call for the Queſtion; the Queſtion ought to be, not <hi>Whether the Bill ſhall be read the ſecond time</hi> (which is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe,) but <hi>Whether it ſhall be Rejected</hi> Whereas to a Bill coming from the Lords ſo much favour and reſpect is ſhewn, that if, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Reading, it be ſpoken againſt, and preſſed to be put to the Queſtion, the Speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>When the Queſtion for Rejection is made, and the greater Voice is to have the Bill Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Clerk ought to ſet it down <hi>Rejected</hi> in the Journal, and ſo to Indorſe it on the back of the Bill; and it ſhall be no more Read that Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                        </gap>ade, when the Bill is denied to be Committed; yet it is not done, till the Bill be Read the third time.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſubject Matter of the Debates, the Speaker is not to argue for, or againſt any ſide; but only to hear the Arguments of the Houſe, and (as I ſaid before) to collect the ſubſtance of them. Neither has he any Voice, but the Caſting Voice.</p>
                     <p>Whoever ſpeaks to a Bill ought to ſtand up Uncovered, and direct his Speech to the Speaker. If two riſe at the ſame time, and fall ſpeaking together, the Speaker has power to determine which ſhall give way to the other. He that ſpeaks is to be heard out, and not interrupted, unleſs by Mr. Speaker; which he may do in ſome Caſes, as when the Diſcourſe ſpins out to too great a length, or is from the Matter in hand, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>None ought to ſpeak twice to a Bill in one Day, unleſs ſometimes by way of Explication. But, if the Bill be oftner Read than once, a Man may ſpeak as often as the Bill is read.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49236:350"/>And, if any Thing be done contrary to the Orders of the Houſe, one may riſe up and ſpeak to it in the midſt of a Debate, in caſe the Speaker do not. For, if the Speaker ſtand up, he is firſt to be heard; and while he ſtands up, the other muſt ſit down. But whoever riſes up to ſpeak to the Orders of the Houſe in the midſt of a Debate muſt keep within that Line, and not fall to the Matter it ſelf. If he do, he may be taken down by the Speaker, or any other Member, calling to the Orders of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>No Member in his Diſcourſe is to mention the Name of any other then preſent, but to deſcribe him by his Title or Addition, as <hi>that Noble Lord, that Worthy Knight.</hi> Or by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as <hi>Judge, Sergeant, Gentleman of the long, or ſhort Robe.</hi> Or by his Place, as <hi>the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man near the Chair, near the Bar, on the other ſide;</hi> or <hi>that Gentleman that ſpake laſt, or laſt ſave one,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>No reviling, or reflecting Expreſſions muſt be uſed. And, though freedom of Speech and Debates be an undoubted Priviledge of the Houſe, yet whatſoever is ſpoken in the Houſe is ſubject to the Cenſure of the Houſe. But, if any ſpeak irreverently or ſeditiouſly againſt the Prince or the Privy Council, he is not only Interrupted, but ſometimes ſent to the Tower.</p>
                     <p>After the Debate is ended, the Speaker ought to put the Queſtion for Ingroſſing. If the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Voices be againſt it, the Clerk ought to make an Entry in his Journal, that the ſame was Daſhed, and to make a Note of it upon the back of the Bill, and the Day when. If for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49236:350"/>it, he muſt make his Entry and Note accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                     <p>A Bill that has been Committed, and is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ought not in an ordinary Courſe to be Recommitted, but either Daſhed or Ingroſſed. Yet, when the Matter is of Importance, it is ſometimes Recommitted, and commonly to the ſame Committee.</p>
                     <p>Some few Days after the Bill has been order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Ingroſſed, the ſame being accordingly Ingroſſed, is offered by the Speaker to be Read the third time, for the Paſſing thereof. And, to prevent carrying of Bills with a few Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it has ſometimes been ordered, that no Bills ſhould be put to the Paſſing until Nine of the Clock; at which time the Houſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly full, or ſhortly after.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis Obſervable, that the Speaker ſeldom puts any one Bill to the Paſſing by it ſelf alone; for he commonly ſtays, till there be divers Bills ready Ingroſſed for the third Reading. And, when he has a convenient Number, (as four, or five) he gives Notice to the Houſe, that <hi>he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth next Day to offer up ſome Bills for the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and deſireth the Houſe to give ſpecial At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance for that purpoſe.</hi> Accordingly the Day following, he puts 'em to the third Reading; firſt private Bills, till the Houſe be pretty full, and then the publick ones Ingroſſed.</p>
                     <p>A Bill being Read the third time by the Clerk of the Houſe, he delivers it to the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; who (as before) Reads the Title, explains the Nature of the Bill, and then tells the Houſe that it has now been Read thrice, and that with their Favours he will put it to the Paſſing. But, before he does it, he pauſeth a while, that the Members may have liberty to ſpeak thereto. For, upon the third Reading, the Matter comes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49236:351"/>to a freſh Debate, and for the moſt part it is more ſpoken unto at this time, than upon any of the former Readings. But then 'tis very rare to have it Recommitted, unleſs it be for ſome particular Clauſe or Proviſo.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, the Debate being over, (the Speaker ſtill holding the Bill in his hand) puts it to the Paſſing thus; <hi>As many as are of Opinion that this Bill ſhould paſs, ſay Yea.</hi> And after the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Voice given, he proceeds thus to the Negative, <hi>As many as are of the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſay No.</hi> Whereupon the Speaker is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Opinion, whether the <hi>Yea's</hi> or the <hi>No</hi>'s have it; and his Opinion is to ſtand at the Judgement of the Houſe, unleſs the Caſe be doubtful, and a Motion be made for the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Houſe. Then the Queſtion is put, whether the <hi>Yea</hi>'s or <hi>No</hi>'s are to go out of the Houſe. Which commonly falls out to be the Lot of the <hi>Yea's,</hi> eſpecially upon a new Bill; for it ſeems but reaſonable, that thoſe ſhould ſit ſtill who are for the old Law, becauſe they are in poſſeſſion of it. To count the Houſe, the Speaker does nominate two of the <hi>Yea's,</hi> and two of the <hi>No's.</hi> Who, having each a Staff in his Hand, are to count the Members that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſitting in the Houſe; and then to ſtand within the Door, two on each ſide, and count the Number of them who went forth, as they come in.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe being thus told, the two Tellers that have the moſt Votes, ſtanding at the Bar on the right hand of the two others (the reſt being all ſet in their places) make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches together to the Table, with the uſual Obeyſance to the Houſe. He that ſtands on the right hand declares to the Speaker the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49236:351"/>of the <hi>Yea's</hi> and <hi>No's.</hi> That done, they all depart, with like Reverence into their Places; and Mr. Speaker makes the Report to the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>If it be carried in the Affirmative, the Clerk is to enter the Vote, <hi>Reſolved.</hi> If in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, thus; <hi>The Queſtion being put</hi> (then he ſets down the Words of the Queſtion) <hi>it paſſed in the Negative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While the Houſe is divided, or dividing in order to gather the Voices, no Member is to ſpeak, or to remove out of his Place, except ſuch as go forth upon the Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>The Bill being thus paſſed, the Clerk (if the Bill be originally exhibited in the Houſe of Commons) ought to write within the Bill on the top toward the right hand, <hi>Soit baille aux Seigneurs,</hi> that is, Let it be ſent up to the Lords. But, if the Bill paſſed be originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Lords Houſe, then ought the Clerk to write underneath the Subſcription of the Lords (which always is at the foot of the Bill) <hi>Ace Bill les Communes ont aſſenti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, when the Speaker has in his hands a convenient Number of Bills ready paſſed, he then puts the Houſe in mind of ſending them up to the Lords, and deſires the Houſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Meſſengers. Amongſt which a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Member of the Houſe is appointed for that purpoſe, to whom the Bills are delivered in ſuch Order as he is to preſent them to the Lords, by the Direction of the Speaker, except the Houſe be pleaſed to give ſpecial Direction therein.</p>
                     <p>This principal Meſſenger, coming in the firſt Rank of his Company (uſually conſiſting of 30 or 40 Members) to the Bar of the Lords Houſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49236:352"/>with three Congies, the Lords riſe from their Places, and come down to meet them at the Bar. Then the chief Meſſenger tells them, that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons have ſent unto their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips certain Bills. Whereupon he reads the Title of every Bill, as it lies in order; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the ſame in an humble manner to the Speaker of the Houſe of Lords, who is come down of purpoſe to receive them.</p>
                     <p>But, when any Anſwer is to be delivered by the Speaker of this Houſe, in the name and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the whole Houſe, to ſuch Knights and Burgeſſes as come from the Commons, the Lords are to keep their Places, and the Speaker is to deliver their Anſwer with his Head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, whilſt the Knights and Burgeſſes ſtand uncovered toward the lower end of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>In this Houſe the Lords give their Voices, beginning at the <hi>Puiſne,</hi> or loweſt Baron, and ſo the reſt <hi>Seriatim,</hi> every one anſwering apart, <hi>Content,</hi> or <hi>Not Content;</hi> firſt for himſelf, and then ſeverally for ſo many as he hath Letters and Proxies.</p>
                     <p>For any Peer of the Realm, by Licenſe of the King upon juſt Cauſe to abſent, may make a Proxy, that is, may conſtitute another Lord to give his Voice in the Upper Houſe, when any Difference of Opinion, and Diviſion of the Houſe ſhall happen. Otherwiſe, if no ſuch Diviſion fall out, it never comes to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or Known to whom ſuch Proxies are directed.</p>
                     <p>By an Order of this Houſe in the Reign of Charles I, it was Ordered, that no Peer ſhould be capable of receiving above two Proxies,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49236:352"/>or more to be numbred in any Cauſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>If a Bill paſſed in one Houſe, and being ſent to the other, this demur upon it, then a <hi>Conference</hi> is demanded in the Painted Chamber. Where the deputed Members of each Houſe meet, the Lords ſitting cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a Table, and the Commons ſtanding bare with great reſpect. There the Buſineſs is debated; and if they cannot agree, it is nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p>When Bills are paſſed by both Houſes, upon three ſeveral Readings in either Houſe, before they can have the force of Law, they muſt have the <hi>Royal Aſſent,</hi> which puts life into them. For, as there is no Act of Parliament but muſt have the Conſent of the Lords and Commons, and the Royal Aſſent of the King; ſo whatſoever paſſeth in Parliament by this threefold Conſent, hath the force of an Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Royal Aſſent, which uſed formerly to be deferred till the laſt Day of the Seſſion, is given after this manner, whenever the King thinks fit. His Majeſty then comes into the Houſe of Peers, with his Crown on his Head, and cloathed with his Royal Robes. Being ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Chair of State, and all the Lords in their Robes, the Houſe of Commons is ſent for up (as before) by the Black Rod. Thus the King, Lords, and Commons being met, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Title of each Bill, and after the Reading of every Title, the Clerk of the Parliament pronounces the Royal Aſſent, according to his Inſtructions from the King. If it be a publick Bill, to which the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49236:353"/>King aſſenteth, the Words are <hi>le Roy le veut,</hi> the King wills it. Whereas to a publick Bill which the King forbears to allow, the Anſwer is, <hi>Le Roy S'aviſera,</hi> the King will conſider; which is look'd upon as a civil Denial. To a Subſidy-Bill, <hi>le Roy remercie ſes loyaux Sujets, accepte leur Benevolence, &amp; auſſi le veut,</hi> the King thanks his loyal Subjects, accepts their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and ſo wills it. And to a private Bill allowed by the King, <hi>Soit fait comme il eſt deſire,</hi> be it done as it is deſired.</p>
                     <p>But, in caſe of a General Pardon, as it is the King's Gift, ſo the Return is from the Lords and Commons to His Majeſty in theſe Words, <hi>los Prelats, Seigneurs, &amp; Communes en ce Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſemblez, au nom de tous vos autres Sujets, remercient tres humblement Votre Majeſte, &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Dieu qu'il vous donne bonne &amp; longue Vie en Sante,</hi> the Prelates, Lords, and Commons in this Parliament aſſembled in the Name of all Your other Subjects, do moſt humbly thank your Majeſty, and pray God to give You a good and long Life in Health.</p>
                     <p>'Tis obſervable in the mean while, how we have retained about making of Laws, ſo many French Expreſſions, derived to us doubtleſs from the Normans.</p>
                     <p>The Uſe of <hi>Committees</hi> is ſo neceſſary for the Diſpatch of Parliament Buſineſs, and their Way of managing Bills ſo fair and honourable, that it will be proper to add ſomething to what has been ſaid before concerning them.</p>
                     <p>They conſiſt of ſuch Members as each Houſe chuſes from among them, to make a ſtrict Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Bills, and therein ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments and Alterations as their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will dictate upon a full Debate among
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49236:353"/>themſelves, and to Report the ſame to the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Now there are three ſorts of <hi>Committees,</hi> viz. <hi>Standing, Select,</hi> and <hi>Grand Committees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are in the Houſe of Commons five <hi>Standing Committees</hi> uſually appointed in the beginning of the Parliament, and remaining du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the Seſſion. Viz. One for <hi>Priviledges and Elections,</hi> another for <hi>Religion,</hi> a third for <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> another for <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> and the fifth for <hi>Trade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongſt which the <hi>Committee for Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Elections</hi> has always had the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being commonly the firſt Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, either the ſame Day the Speaker did take his Place, or the next day after. Their Power was anciently to examine, and make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all Caſes touching Elections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, and all Caſes for Priviledge as might fall out during the Parliament. But that Power has been ſince abridged, eſpecially in Matters of Priviledge; which are heard in the Houſe, and not in a Committee, unleſs in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Caſes.</p>
                     <p>By a <hi>Select Committee,</hi> I mean a Committee particularly choſen to inquire into a Bill. In the Choice whereof this Rule is obſerved in the Houſe, that they who have given their Voice againſt the Body of a Bill, cannot be of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. And, though any Member of the Houſe may be preſent at any ſelect Committee, yet he is not to give any Vote there, unleſs he be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be of the Committee. As to their Number, they are ſeldom leſs than eight, but have been ſometimes many more, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Men well verſed in Parliament Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49236:354"/>
                     <p>Upon the firſt Meeting of a Committee in their Committee Chamber, they chuſe among them a <hi>Chair-man,</hi> who is much like the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>After any Bill is Committed upon the ſecond Reading, it may be delivered indifferently to any of the Committee. Who are firſt to read it, and then to conſider the ſame by Parts. If there be any Preamble, 'tis uſually conſidered after the other Parts of the Bill. The Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon Conſideration of the body of the Bill ſuch Alterations may therein be made, as may alſo occaſion the Alteration of the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is beſt done laſt</p>
                     <p>The Committee may not raze, interline, or blot the Bill it ſelf; but muſt in a Paper by it ſelf ſet down the Amendments. Which ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oe done by ſetting down in the Paper the Number of the Folio where the Amendment is made, naming the Place particularly where the Words of the Amendment are to be Inſerted, or thoſe of the Bill Omitted. The Breviat alſo annexed to the Bill muſt be amended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and made to agree with the Bill.</p>
                     <p>When all the Amendments are perfected, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one being Voted ſingly, all of them are to be read at the Committee, and put to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the ſame ſhall be Reported to the Houſe.</hi> But, when the Vote is to be put, any Member of the Committee may move to add to thoſe Amendments, or to Amend any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Bill.</p>
                     <p>If the Vote of the Committee paſs in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, then commonly the Chair-man is appointed to make the Report. Which being done, that Committee is diſſolved, and can act no more without a new Power.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49236:354"/>
                     <p>The uſual Time for the Houſe to receive the Reports is, after the Houſe is full. And 'tis commonly the firſt Thing they go then upon; unleſs there be Bills Ingroſſed, which are to take place, and publick Bills before pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
                     <p>The Reporter muſt firſt acquaint the Houſe, That he is to make a Report from ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to whom ſuch a Bill was Committed. Then ſtanding in his place, he reads each of the Amendments, with the Coherence in the Bill; opens withal the Alterations, and ſhews the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Committee for ſuch Amendments, until he has gone through all. When that is done, if his Seat be not next the Floor, he muſt come from his Place to the Bar, and ſo come up to the Table; where he delivers both the Bill and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments to the Clerk, to be read. Whilſt he ſtands by the Clerk, the Clerk reads twice the Amendments only that are to be Inſerted, and then he delivers the Bill with the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Speaker.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon any Member may ſpeak againſt all, or any of the Amendments, and deſire the Coherence to be read. But he is to make all his Objections at once to all the Amendments, without ſpeaking again.</p>
                     <p>Note, that in the Houſe of Lords, the Judges, and other Aſſiſtants there of the long Robe, are ſometimes Joyned to the Lords Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, though they have no Voice in the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>But whereas in the Houſe they ſit covered by the Leave of the Peers, at a Committee they are always uncovered.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Grand Committee,</hi> called a <hi>Committee of the whole Houſe,</hi> is the Houſe it ſelf reſolved into a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49236:355"/>freedom of Debate from the Rules of the Houſe to the Nature of a Committee; and therefore 'tis commonly called <hi>a Committee of the whole Houſe.</hi> Theſe Grand Committees are uſed, when any great Buſineſs is in hand that requires much Debate; as Bills to impoſe a Tax, or raiſe Mony from the People. Which Bills particularly do always begin in the Houſe of Commons, as their Repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Committees every Member is free to ſpeak to one Queſtion as often as he ſhall ſee Cauſe, (which is not permitted in the Houſe) and to anſwer other Mens Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So that it is a more open Way, and ſuch as leads moſt to the Truth; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding more honourable and advantagious, both to King and Parliament.</p>
                     <p>When the Houſe inclines to reſolve it ſelf into a Committee, it is done by a Queſtion. Which being carried in the Affirmative, the Speaker leaves the Chair, and thereupon the Committee makes choice of a <hi>Chair-man.</hi> If a Diſpute ariſes about the Choice, the Speaker is called back to his Chair; and after the Choice is cleared, he leaves it. The Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſits in the Clerks Place at the Table, and writes the Votes of the Committee; the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering whereof is according to the Rules of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>When the Committee has gone through the Matter in hand, the Chair-man, having read all the Votes, puts the Queſtion, <hi>That the ſame be Reported to the Houſe.</hi> If that be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he is to leave the Chair; and the Speaker being called again to the Chair, the Chair-man is to Report what has been reſolved at the Committee, ſtanding in his uſual Place. From whence, if it be not in the Seat next
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49236:355"/>the Floor, he is to go down to the Bar, and ſo to bring up his Report to the Table.</p>
                     <p>In caſe the Committee cannot perfect the Buſineſs at that ſitting, Leave is to be asked, <hi>That the Committee may Sit at another time on that Buſineſs.</hi> But, if the Matter has been throughly Debated, and is judged fit to be Reſolved in the Houſe, the Speaker is called to the Chair for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>In other Things the Proceedings are the ſame as in the Houſe. And ſo much for the Committees.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to the Manner of <hi>Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Proroguing,</hi> or <hi>Diſſolving</hi> the Parliament, which is done at the Kings Pleaſure, and that in the Houſe of Lords, with the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and Solemnity as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Adjournment</hi> and <hi>Prorogation</hi> are to ſome convenient time appointed by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but with this Difference, that an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment</hi> do's not conclude the Seſſion, which a <hi>Prorogation</hi> do's. So that by an <hi>Adjournment</hi> all Things debated in both Houſes remain <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> and at the next Meeting may be brought to an Iſſue. Whereas a <hi>Prorogation</hi> makes a Seſſion; and then ſuch Bills as paſſed either Houſe, or both Houſes, and had not the Royal Aſſent, muſt at the next Aſſembly begin anew, before they can be brought to perfection.</p>
                     <p>Upon an <hi>Adjournment,</hi> or <hi>Prorogation,</hi> the King do's uſually make a Speech to both Houſes of Parliament. And he ought to be there in Perſon, or by Repreſentation, as on the Day of their firſt ſitting, Now the Kings Perſon may be repreſented by Commiſſion under the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49236:356"/>Great Seal to certain Lords in Parliament, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing them to begin, adjourn, prorogue, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis Obſervable, that each Houſe has alſo a Power to Adjourn themſelves, which when they do, 'tis at the moſt but for a few Days.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Diſſolution</hi> is that whereby the Houſe of Commons becomes Vacant, in order to a new Election. Now a Parliament may be Diſſolved by the King at any time, whether they be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſitting, or not.</p>
                     <p>But, if a Parliament do ſit, and be Diſſolved, without any Act of Parliament paſſed, or Judgment given, 'tis no Seſſion of Parliament, but a Convention.</p>
                     <p>The King being the Head of the Parliament, if his Death happens when there is a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>'Twas a Cuſtom of old, after every Seſſion of Parliament, for the Sheriff to Proclaim, by the Kings Command, the ſeveral Acts paſſed in that Seſſion, that none might pretend Ignorance. And yet, without that Proclamation, the Law ſuppoſes every one has noticeby his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of what is tranſacted in Parliament. But that Cuſtom has been laid aſide, ſince Printing came to be of common Uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament ought to ſit, by Law, at leaſt once in three Years.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have laid open the Supream Court of England, which without the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence can legally, do nothing that's binding to the Nation, but with it can do any thing. For whatever is done by this Conſent is called firm, ſtable, and <hi>ſanctum,</hi> and is taken for Law. Thus the King and Parliament may abrogate old Laws, and make new, ſettle the Succeſſion to the Crown, Define of doubtful Rights
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49236:356"/>whereof no Law is made, Appoint Taxes and Subſidies, Eſtabliſh Forms of Religion, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize Aliens, Legitimate Baſtards, Adjudge an Infant (or Minor) to be of full Age, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint a Man of Treaſon after his Death, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or Abſolve them who are put upon their Trial, Give the moſt free Pardons, Reſtore in Bloud and Name, &amp;c. And the Conſent of the Parliament is taken to be the Conſent of every Engliſhman, being there preſent in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by Procuration.</p>
                     <p>King John having reſigned up the Crown of England to the Pope, and ſubmitted to take it at his hand again at a yearly Tribute, the Pope (in the Reign of Edward III.) demanded his Rent, and all the Arrears. Upon which iſſued this Reſolve of the Parliament, <hi>that neither the King, nor any other, could put the Realm, nor the People thereof, into a forein Subjection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Aſſent.</hi> This was a high Reſolution in Law, in one of the higheſt Points of Law, concerning the Kings Claim of an abſolute Power, when the Pope was in his height. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this intimates, that with their joynt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Crown may be diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>But, how tranſcendent ſoever be the Power and Authority of the King and Parliament, yet it do's not extend ſo far as to bar, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, or make void ſubſequent Parliaments; and, tho divers Parliaments have attempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, yet they could never effect it. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atter Parliament hath ſtill a Power to abrogate, ſuſpend, qualify, explain, or make void the former in the Whole, or any Part thereof, notwithſtanding any Words of Reſtraint, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, or Penalty in the former; it being a Maxim in the Law of Parliament, <hi>Quod Leges
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49236:357"/>poſteriores priores contrarias abrogant.</hi> 'Twas therefore but in vain, that the late King James pretended ſo to ſettle that Liberty of Conſcience which he uſhered in by his Declaration, as to make it a Law unalterable, like the Laws of the Medes and Perſians. It was but a Blind for Diſſenters to bring them into his Snare; and, tho he had really deſigned it, he muſt have been at leaſt Immortal to ſecure it.</p>
                     <p>One of the fundamental and principal Ends of Parliaments was to Redreſs Grievances, and eaſe the People of Oppreſſions. The chief Care whereof is in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as being the Grand Inqueſt of the Realm, ſummoned from all Parts to preſent publick Grievances to be redreſſed, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Delinquents puniſhed, as corrupted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, Judges, and Magiſtrates. Therefore Parliaments are a great Check to Men in Authority, and conſequently abhorred by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents. Who muſt expect one time or other to be called to a ſtrict and impartial Account, and be puniſhed according to their Demerits. Remember, ſaid the Lord Bacon to his Friend <hi>Sr. Lionel Cranfield,</hi> when he was made Lord Treaſurer, that <hi>a Parliament will come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Caſe the Houſe of Commons (the Parliament ſitting) Impeaches, and the Houſe of Lords are the Judges; the Commons In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, Preſent, and Manage the Evidence, the Lords upon a full Trial give Judgment upon it. And ſuch is the Priviledge of the Houſe of Commons in this particular, that they may Impeach the higheſt Lord in the Kingdom, either Spiritual or Temporal; and he is not to have the benefit of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act (that is, he cannot come out upon Bail) till
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49236:357"/>his Trial be over, or the Parliament Diſſolved, which laſt ſome of the late Judges have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for. But the Lords cannot proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Commoner, except upon a Complaint of the Commons.</p>
                     <p>In a Caſe of Miſdemeanour both the Lords Spiritual and Temporal are Judges, and the Kings Aſſent to the Judgment is not neceſſary. But, if the Crime be Capital, the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual (tho, as Barons, they might ſit as Judges, yet they) abſent themſelves during the Trial; becauſe, by the Decrees of the Church, they may not be Judges of Life and Death. For, by an Ordinance made at the Council at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter in 21 Hen. 2. all Clergymen were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <hi>agitare Judicium Sanguinis,</hi> upon pain to be deprived both of Dignities and Orders.</p>
                     <p>When a Peer is Impeached of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Court is uſually erected for his Trial in Weſtminſter-Hall; and the King makes a Lord Steward (which commonly is the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour) to ſit as Judge thereof. The Trial being over, the Lords Temporal reſorting to their Houſe give Judgment upon it, by Voting the Party arraigned, upon their Honours, <hi>Guilty, or not Guilty;</hi> and he is either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, or Acquitted by the Plurality of Voices. If found Guilty, he receives Sentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by the Mouth of the Lord High Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Lords is alſo, in Civil Cauſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49236:358"/>again before the Lords upon a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>In Caſe of Recovery of Damages, or Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the Parties are to have their Remedy (the Parliament being ended) in the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not in any inferiour Court at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. But the Lords in Parliament may direct how it ſhall be levied.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, by the ancient Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kingdom, it belongs to the Houſe of Peers to interpret Acts of Parliament, in Time of Parliament, in any Cauſe that ſhall be brought before Them.</p>
                     <p>I conclude with the <hi>Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which are great in both Houſes, and fit for ſo honourable a Court.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as to the Perſons of the Commoners, they are Priviledged from Suits, Arreſts, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, except in Caſe of Treaſon and Felony; alſo, from Attendance on Trials in inferiour Courts, ſerving on Juries, and the like. Their neceſſary Servants that tend upon them during the Parliament, are alſo Priviledged from Arreſt, except in the aforeſaid Caſes. Which Priviledge is their due, <hi>eundo, morando, redeundo,</hi> that is, not only for that time the Parliament ſits, but alſo during 40 Days before, and 40 Days after the Parliament finiſhed. And that, not only for the Perſons of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and their neceſſary Servants; but alſo, in ſome Caſes, for their Goods and Eſtates du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Time.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this Priviledge do's likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch Officers as attend the Parliament; as the Clerks, the Sergeant at Arms, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Door, and the like.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49236:358"/>
                     <p>But, if one was Arreſted before he was choſen Burgeſs, he is not to have the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Many are the Precedents, which ſhew the Reſentments of this Houſe againſt ſuch as have offered to act contrary to theſe Priviledges, and their ſevere Proceedings againſt ſome of them, either for ſerving a <hi>Subpoena</hi> upon, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting a Member of this Houſe, or refuſing to deliver a Member arreſted for Debt, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſitting. For common Reaſon will have it, that the King and his whole Realm having an Intereſt in the Body of every one of its Members, all private Intereſt ſhould yield to the Publick, ſo that no Man ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Service of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much has been the Priviledge of the Houſe inſiſted on, that it has been a Queſtion, Whether any Member of the Houſe could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be ſued during the Seſſion; becauſe the Priviledge is not ſo much the Perſon's the Houſe's. And therefore, when any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has been brought to the Bar for any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this nature, the Speaker has uſually charged the Perſon in the name of the whole Houſe, as a Breach of the Priviledge of this Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, for offering to threaten, or to give abuſive Language to any Member of the Houſe, or to ſpeak irreverently of the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in Time of Parliament, ſeveral have been ſent for by the Sergeant to anſwer it to the Houſe, and Committed.</p>
                     <p>Dec. 1641. it was Reſolved, that <hi>the ſetting of any Gards about this Houſe, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Houſe, is a Breach of the Priviledge of this Houſe, and that therefore ſuch Gards ought to be diſmiſſed.</hi>

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49236:359"/>
                     <p>Which Reſolve was followed by three others <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> The firſt, that <hi>the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament were broken by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties taking notice of the Bill for ſuppreſſing of Souldiers, being in agitation in both Houſes, and not agreed on.</hi> The ſecond, that <hi>his Majeſty, in propounding a Limitation and proviſional Clauſe to be added to the Bill, before it was preſented to Him by the Conſent of both Houſes, was a Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</hi> The third, that <hi>His Majeſty expreſſing his Diſpleaſure againſt ſome Perſons, for Matters moved in the Parliament, during the Debate and preparation of that Bill, was a Breach of the Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, whereas in January following the King did come to the Houſe of Commons in a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manner with armed Men, ſome poſted at the very Door of the Houſe, and others in other Places and Paſſages near it, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Members then fitting, and treating in a peaceable and orderly manner of the great Affairs of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland; and His Majeſty, having placed himſelf in the Speakers Chair, did demand the Perſons of divers Members of the Houſe to be delivered unto him; It was thereupon declared by the Houſe, that <hi>the ſame is a high Breach of the Rights and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inconſiſtent with the Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thereof; and therefore the Houſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they could not with ſafety of their own Perſons, or the Indemnities of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, ſit there any longer, without a full Vindication of ſo high a Breach of Priviledge, and a ſufficient Gard wherein they might conſide.</hi>

                     <p>NEXT to the Court of Parliament, which is the great Wheel that gives motion to the reſt, is <hi>the Kings Privy Council.</hi> A Court of great Honour and Antiquity; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated (as it were) to the King Himſelf, and bearing part of his Cares in the great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſs of the Government.

For, according to their Oath, they are chiefly to Adviſe the King upon all Emergencies to the beſt of their Judgment, with all the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Secrecy that becomes their Station. And, as the King has the ſole Nomination of them, ſo 'tis his main Intereſt to make choice of ſuch eminent Perſons as are beſt able, with their Wiſdom, Experience, and Integrity, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nſwer thoſe great Ends they are appointed for.</p>
                     <p>They ought to be Perſons of ſeveral Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, that nothing be wanting for good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Advice in a Court from whence in a great meaſure depends the Safety, Honour, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49236:360"/>Welfare of the King and Kingdom. General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are pickt out amongſt the Nobility; and, for Things that relate to Church Affairs the Arch-biſhop of Canterbury and the Biſhop of London uſe to be Members thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the late Kings Reign, not only Popiſh Lords were admitted contrary to Law; but, in defiance as it were of the Nation, a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by the Law, and the worſt of Counſellours, a mercurial hot-headed <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> whoſe perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Counſels and Influences proved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fatal to King James, and all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party.</p>
                     <p>As for the Number of Privy Counſellours, 'tis at His Majeſties pleaſure. Anciently they uſed to be but twelve, or thereabouts; but, ſince, their Number has increaſed ſometimes to forty.</p>
                     <p>The Privy Council is kept in the Kings Court, or Pallace, and the King himſelf do's commonly ſit with them. The uſual Days for their ſitting is Wedneſdays and Fridays, in the Morning out of Parliament or Term-time, and in the Afternoon in Parliament or Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. But, upon extraordinary Occaſions, the King calls them together at any time. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they wait on His Majeſty in the Council-Chamber, and fit at the Council Board in their Order, bare-headed, when the King preſides. To whom His Majeſty declares what He thinks fit, and deſires their Advice in it. At all Debates the loweſt Counſellour delivers his Opinion firſt, that ſo he may be the more free; and the King laſt of all, by declaring his Judgment, determines the Matter.</p>
                     <p>'Tis with the Advice of the Privy Council, that the King puts out Proclamations, Orders, and Declarations, which being grounded upon

                     <p>Laſtly, they have the Cuſtody of the <hi>Signet,</hi> one of the Kings Seals. To which belongs the <hi>Signet-Office,</hi> where four Clerks wait Monthly by turns, preparing ſuch Things as are to paſs the <hi>Signet,</hi> in order to the Privy Seal, or Great Seal. He that is in waiting is always to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Court, whereſoever it removes; and to prepare ſuch Bills or Letters for the King to ſign (not being Matter of Law) as by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords of the Council he is directed to prepare. And to this Office all Grants prepared by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the Kings Learned Council at Law, for the Kings hand, are returned, when ſigned, and there tranſcribed again. The Tranſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is carried to one of the Principal Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of State, to be ſealed with the Signet. This done, it is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant for iſſuing out a Privy Seal upon it. But then it muſt be firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the Clerks of the Seal, who are alſo four in Number; and, when it has the Privy Seal affixt, 'tis ſufficient for the Payment of any Monies out of the Exchequer, and for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Uſes. If the Grant requires the paſſing the Great Seal, as ſeveral Grants do, the Privy Seal is a Warrant to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour (or the Lords Commiſſioners) to paſs it, as the Signet was to the Lord Privy Seal. But here alſo a new Tranſcription muſt be made of the Grant. The Reaſon why a Grant muſt go through ſo many Hands and Seals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be perfected, is, that it may be duly conſidered, and all Objections cleared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it take its effect.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Paper-Office,</hi> at Whitehall, is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the Secretaries of State. Where all the Papers and Diſpatches that paſs through
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49236:362"/>their Offices (as Matters of State and Council, Letters, Intelligences, and Negotiations of forein Miniſters here, or of the Kings Miniſters abroad) are from time to time tranſmitted, and there remain, diſpoſed by way of Library. The Keeper whereof has a yearly Salary of 160 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> payable out of the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Lords of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have always been of ſuch high value and eſteem, that if a Man did but ſtrike another in a Privy Counſellors Houſe, or elſewhere in his preſence, he was fined for the ſame. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the Death of any of them was Felony in any of the Kings Servants, and to kill one of them was High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>A Privy Counſellour, though but a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, has precedence of all Knights Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Viſcounts. And a Secretary of State has this ſpecial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that, if he be a Baron, he takes place (as ſuch) of all other Barons. So honourable an Imployment it is, that in the late Reign the Earl of Sunderland, was both principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, and Lord Preſident of the Privy Council.</p>

                     <p>All the fore-mentioned Courts are opened four times a Year, called the four Terms; Viz. <hi>Eaſter, Trinity, Michaelmas,</hi> and <hi>Hilary Term.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> begins always the 17th Day after Eaſter, and laſteth 27 Days. <hi>Trinity</hi> (or <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer</hi>) <hi>Term</hi> begins the fifth Day after Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sunday, and laſteth 20 Days. <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi> begins the 23th of October, and laſteth 37 Days.

                     <p>Next to the Parliament of England, and the Kings Privy Council, by whoſe Influences the Nation is chiefly governed under the King, the <hi>High Court of Chancery</hi> is the chief, and the moſt ancient Court of Judicature. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49236:363"/>called the <hi>Court of Equity,</hi> in oppoſition to other inferiour Courts, the Judges whereof are tied to the Letter of the Law; Whereas this is a Court of Mercy, in which the Rigour of the Law is tempered with Equity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings of England would have this Court Superiour to the other Tribunals, as well as for being the Original of all other Courts, and the Fountain of all our Proceedings in Law. For, as <hi>Sir Edward Coke</hi> ſays, this Court is <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficina Juſtitiae,</hi> out of which all Original Writs and all Commiſſions which paſs under the Great Seal go forth, which Great Seal is <hi>Clavis Regni,</hi> the Key of the Kingdom; and for thoſe ends this Court is always open.</p>
                     <p>In the Chancery are two Courts, one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and the other Extraordinary. In the firſt the Proceedings are in Latine, <hi>Secundum Legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Angliae,</hi> according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. In the ſecond, by Engliſh Bill, <hi>Secundum aequum &amp; bonum,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Equity.</p>
                     <p>The Manner of Proceeding is much like that in the Courts of the Civil Law; the Actions by Bill or Plaint, the Witneſſes examined in private, and the Decrees in Engliſh or Latin, not in French. No Jury of twelve Men, but all Sentences given by the Judge of the Court.</p>
                     <p>The Judge is the <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> or <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> of the Great Seal, the higheſt Dignity that a Lay-man is capable of in England, and held of the King <hi>durante Beneplacito.</hi> But now this Office is executed by three Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</p>
                     <p>Next to whom there are twelve Aſſiſtants called <hi>Maſters of the Chancery,</hi> who are Civilians. Their Salary is each 100 Pound, paid out of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49236:363"/>the Exchequer quarterly, beſides Robe-mony. Three of theſe at a time ſit in the Chancery Court in Term-time, and two out of Term, when the Chancellour ſits to hear Cauſes at his own Houſe Who often refers to them the further hearing of Cauſes, &amp;c. Theſe Maſters have a publick Office, where one or more of them do conſtantly attend, to take Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The chief of them is the <hi>Maſter of the Rolls,</hi> whoſe Place is both very honourable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.

It grants Prohibitions to Courts Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical, to Keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their proper Juriſdiction; and may bail any Perſon for any Offence whatſoever. If a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in City, Borough, or Town Corporate, be Disfranchiſed unjuſtly, this Court may relieve the Party, although he has no Priviledge in it.</p>
                     <p>This Court moreover has power to hold Plea by Bill for Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Promiſe, and all other perſonal Actions, againſt any that is in the Marſhals Cuſtody, or any Officer, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, or Clerk of the Court. For, if they ſhould be ſued in any other Court, they would
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49236:366"/>be allowed the Priviledge of this, in reſpect of their neceſſary Attendance here; and, leſt there ſhould be a failure of Juſtice, they ſhall be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded here by Bill, though theſe Actions be common Pleas. Likewiſe the Officers, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Clerks of this Court, priviledged by Law, may Implead others by Bill here in the foreſaid Actions.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Juriſdiction of this Court is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and extends all over England. 'Tis more uncontrolable than any other Court, becauſe the Law preſumes the King to be there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For anciently the Kings of England ſat ſometimes in this Court, and that on a high Bench, his Judges at his Feet, on a low Bench. From whence ſome think this Court came to be called the <hi>King's Bench.</hi> However the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture always belonged to the Judges, and in the King's preſence (as now in his abſence) they anſwered all Motions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So Supream is alſo the Juriſdiction of this Court, that, if any Record be removed hither, it cannot (being as it were in its Center) be remanded back, but by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>In this Court ſit commonly four Grave Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Judges, The principal whereof is called the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench,</hi> and is thus created by Writ. <hi>A. B. Militi Salutem. Sciatis quod Conſtituimus Vos Judiciarium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Capitalem, ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito noſtro. Teſte meipſo apud</hi> Weſtm.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the Judges of the King's Bench hold their Places by Letters Patent in theſe Words. <hi>Rex omnibus ad quos praeſentes Litera pervenerint, Salutem. Sciatis quod Conſtituimus dilectum &amp; fidelem B. C. Militem unum Juſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49236:366"/>ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito noſtro. Teſte,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Though in the Writ or Patent made to theſe Judges they are not named Sergeants, yet none can be a Judge of this Court, unleſs he be a Sergeant of the Degree of the Coif, that is, a Sergeant at Law; who, upon taking this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is obliged to wear a Lawn Coif under a black Cap.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Judges, or Juſtices, are the Sovereign Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> Goal-Delivery, Conſervators of the Peace, &amp;c. in the Realm. So that, when this Court comes and ſits in any County, the Juſtices of <hi>Eire,</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> and <hi>Goal-Delivery,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, without writing to them. They are likewiſe the Sovereign Coroners of the Land; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the Sheriff and Coroners may receive Appeals by Bill, much rather the Juſtices of this Court may do it.</p>
                     <p>Their Salary from the King is each 1000 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides Robes and Liveries out of the great Wardrobe, and two Tun of Wine to the Lord Chief Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>In this Court all young Lawyers that have been called to the Bar are allowed to practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Here are three diſtinct <hi>Offices;</hi> Viz. the <hi>Crown Office,</hi> the <hi>Protonotaries,</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium's Office.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Court of Common-Pleas.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THis Court is ſo called, becauſe here are debated the uſual Pleas between Subject and Subject. For in this Court all Civil Cauſes, real and perſonal, are uſually tried, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrictneſs of the Law. And real Actions are pleadable; nor Fines levied, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries ſuffered, in no other Court but this. Which may alſo grant Prohibitions, as the Court of the King's Bench doth.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo commonly four Judges, the chief whereof is called the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas,</hi> or <hi>of the Common Bench.</hi> Who holds his Place by Letters Patent, as the other Three do, <hi>derante Beneplacito.</hi> Their Fee is the ſame as that of the King's Bench Judges.</p>
                     <p>None but Sergeants at Law may plead in this Court; and ſo many of them as the King ſhall appoint, are bound by Oath to aſſiſt all that have any Cauſe depending here; for which the King allows them Fees, Reward, and Robes.</p>
                     <p>Many are the Officers belonging to this Court. The principal whereof is the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> who is the firſt Clerk of the Court, and whoſe Office is to receive and keep all Writs returna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here, to receive of the Protonotaries all the Records of <hi>Niſi-prius,</hi> called <hi>Poſteas.</hi> He holds
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49236:368"/>his Place by Patent from the King, has the Gift of the ſecond Protontaries Place, and of the Clerk of the Juries.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Three Protonotaries,</hi> who enter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll all Declarations, Pleadings, Aſſizes, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Actions, and make out Judicial Writs. In whoſe Offices all the Attorneys of this Court enter their Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Now each of them has a <hi>Secondary,</hi> who draws up the Rules of Court, &amp;c. And theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condaries are commonly the ableſt Clerks or Attorneys of the Court.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a <hi>Chirographer,</hi> whoſe chief Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to ingroſs Fines acknowledged; and for whoſe Office there is a <hi>Regiſter,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Clerks,</hi> having their ſeveral Counties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them, for which they Ingroſs the Fines levied of Lands in their reſpective Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>All which forementioned Officers are Sworn, and hold their Offices for Life, as a Freehold. They ſit in the Court covered with black round Caps, ſuch as were in faſhion before the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hats.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there are in this Court three Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers unſworn, who hold their Places <hi>durante Beneplacito.</hi> Viz. 1. A <hi>Clerk of the Treaſury,</hi> whoſe Office is in the Gift of the Lord Chief Juſtice. He Keeps the Records of this Court, and makes out (amongſt other Things) all Records of <hi>Niſt Prius.</hi> 2. The <hi>Clerk of the Inrollments of Fines and Recoveries,</hi> who is by Statute under the three Puiſne Judges of this Court, and removable at their Pleaſure. 3. The <hi>Clerk of the Outlawries;</hi> who, after the Party is returned Outlawed, makes out the Writs of <hi>Capias Uelegatum,</hi> in the name of the Attorney General, to whom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49236:368"/>this Office does properly belong, and who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth it by Deputy.</p>
                     <p>There is beſides a <hi>Clerk of the Warrants,</hi> who enters all Warrants of Attorney for Plaintiff and Defendant, and inrolls all Deeds acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before any of the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clerk of the King's Silver,</hi> to whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fine (or final Agreement upon Sale of Land) is brought, after it has been with the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> and to whom Mony is paid for the King's Uſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Juries,</hi> who makes out the Writs called <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and other Writs for appearance of the Jury.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Eſſoins,</hi> or Excuſes for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cauſe of Abſence.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Clerk of the Superſedeas,</hi> who makes out the Writs of <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> which formerly was done by an Exigenter.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo 15 <hi>Filazers</hi> for the ſeveral Counties of England; who (amongſt many other Things) make out all Proceſs upon Original Writs. Theſe are in the Gift of the Lord Chief Juſtice, and hold for Life. As alſo</p>
                     <p>The <hi>four Exigenters;</hi> whoſe Office is to make all Exigents and Proclamations in all Actions where Proceſs of Outlawry does ly. Now an Exigent is a Writ ſo called, becauſe it requires the Parties Appearance to anſwer the Law, and lies againſt a Tranſgreſſor of the Law that can't be found, nor any of his Goods within the County. Whereupon he is Summoned by the Sheriff at five ſeveral County Courts; and, if he appear not, he is Outlawed, that is, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Protection of the Law. Which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49236:369"/>looks upon him as unworthy of it, that acts in contempt of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there are four <hi>Criers,</hi> and a <hi>Porter,</hi> belonging to this Court.</p>

                     <p>THeſe two I joyn together, becauſe they both concern the King's Revenue, and take Cognizance of all Cauſes ariſing from it.</p>
                     <p>The Judges of this Court are called <hi>Barons of the Exchequer,</hi> ever ſince Barons of the Realm uſed to ſit here as Judges; though in latter times Men learned in the Law have uſually fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up this Station. They are commonly four that ſit in this Tribunal, as in the two former Courts; the principal whereof is ſtiled Lord <hi>Chief Baron.</hi> But 'tis to be obſerved, that the Lord Treaſurer and the Chancellour of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, may ſit here as Principal, though they ſeldom do it.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, to hold this Dignity, <hi>Quamdiu ſe bene geſſerit,</hi> which the Law intends for Life; ſo that he is better fixed than either of the Chief Juſtices. His Place is of great Honour and Profit. In Matter of Law, Information, and Plea, he anſwers the Bar, and gives Order for Judgement thereupon. He alone in the Term-time
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49236:369"/>doth ſit upon <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> that come out of the King's Remembrancer's Office, or out of the Office of the Clerk of the Pleas, which can not be diſpatched in the Mornings for want of time. He takes Recognizances for the King's Debts, for Appearances, and Obſerving of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. He takes the Preſentation of all Officers in Court under himſelf, and of the Mayor of London, and ſees the King's Remembrancer to give them their Oaths. He alſo takes the Declaration of certain Receivers Accounts of the Lands of the late Augmentation made before him by the Auditors of the Shires, and gives two <hi>Parcel-makers</hi> Places by vertue of his Office.</p>
                     <p>In his abſence, his Place is ſupplied by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Barons, his Aſſiſtants, according to their Seniority.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Judges, and thoſe of the two former Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, make up the Number of Twelve; who all ſit in on their Tribunals in Robes, and ſquare Caps.</p>
                     <p>Next to the four Barons of this Court, is firſt the <hi>Curſitor,</hi> who adminiſters the Oath to the Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Searchers, Surveyors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Cuſtom-Houſe.</p>

Here alſo are taken all Securities, either by Bonds or Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances to the King, for the faithful Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe Perſons imployed in the Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Majeſties Revenue, and for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Debts. And all Proceedings upon

From whence accordingly iſſue forth Proceſs, to cauſe all Accountants to come in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And, as the Exchequer do's conſiſt of two Courts, the one of Law, and the other of Equity, all Proceedings touching the ſame are in this Office, with many other Things relating to the Kings Revenue. To this Office, being in the Kings Gift, belong eight ſworn <hi>Clerks,</hi> whereof the two firſt are called <hi>Secondaries.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Sheriffs, and their two Courts, called the County-Court, and the Sheriffs Turn; of Juſtices of Peace, and their Quarter-Seſſions; with an Account of the Grand Jury; of the Coroners, Clerks of the Markets, and their Courts.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR the Civil Government of Counties, Cities, Towns, and Villages, there are divers Officers, to whom belong ſeveral Courts for the due Adminiſtration of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in every County (except Durham and Weſtmorland) there is a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> which is a yearly Office, the Power whereof extends all over the County, except ſuch Cities and Towns as are Counties of themſelves, that is, which have the Priviledge of Counties. In Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex only there are two <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of London the Capital City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were heretofore choſen, as Knights of the Shire, by the Suffrages of the People: But now they are appointed by the King, after this manner. Firſt the Judges no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſix fit Men of each County, that is, Knights or Eſquires of good Eſtates. Out of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49236:372"/>that Number three are choſen by the Privy Counſellors, and the twelve Judges aſſembled in the Exchequer, and there ſworn in order to it. And out of this Number the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chuſes whom he thinks fit.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore the ſame Sheriff ſerved many years together, and to this day this Office is hereditary to the <hi>Cliffords</hi> in the County of Weſtmorland, by Charter from King John.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Office is both Miniſterial, and Judicial. As Miniſterial, he is to execute the Kings Mandates, and all Writs directed to him out of the Kings Courts, to Impannel Juries, to bring Cauſes and Criminals to Trial, and to ſee the Sentences executed. In ſhort, there is no Execution of the Law but by the Sheriff, for by him all Suits begin, and all Proceſs ſerved. He is likewiſe to collect all publick Profit, as Taxes, Fines, Diſtreſſes, and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaments into the Kings Exche quer, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King ſhall appoint; and to make ſuch Payments out of it, as he ſhall have due Order for. At the Aſſizes he is to wait on, and gard the Itinerant Judges, ſo long as they continue within the County.</p>
                     <p>As to the Judicial Part of his Office, he holds, by virtue thereof, two ſeveral Courts; the one called the <hi>County-Court,</hi> and the other the <hi>Sheriffs Turn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>County-Court</hi> is held every Month by the <hi>Sheriff</hi> himſelf, or his Deputy the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Sheriff</hi> wherein he hears and determines Civil Cauſes of the County under 40 ſhillings, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was a conſiderable Sum. But this is no Court of Record.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sheriffs Turn</hi> is held twice a Year, viz. within a month after Eaſter, and within a mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> after Michaelmas. In this Court he inquire
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49236:372"/>of all Criminal Offences againſt the Common Law, wherein he is not reſtrained by any Statute. For all the Biſhops, Earls, Barons, and all ſuch as have Hundreds of their own to be kept, are exempted from the Juriſdiction of this Court. In ſhort, this is a Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in all Things that belong to it. 'Tis the Kings Leet through all the County, whereof the <hi>Sheriff</hi> is Judge, this Court being incident to his Office.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Juſtices of Peace,</hi> anciently called <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> (or <hi>Gardians</hi>) <hi>of the Peace,</hi> are ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentry (and ſometimes amongſt the Clergy) as are appointed by the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to attend the Peace of the County where they dwell.</p>
                     <p>Their Original is from the firſt year of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the III, but they were not called Juſtices till the 36th Year of his Reign.</p>
                     <p>Their Office is to call before them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and commit to Priſon Rioters, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Rogues, Thieves, Murderers, falſe Moneyers, thoſe that hold Conſpiracies, and almoſt all Delinquents that may occaſion the Breach of Peace and Quiet to the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to ſee them brought forth in due time to Trial.</p>
                     <p>If any one Swears himſelf to be in danger of his Life upon the Threats of another, he may bind him over to his good Behaviour, and the Juſtice ſhall commit him to Priſon, unleſs the finds good Security for his good Behaviour during a Year and a Day.</p>
                     <p>Among the Juſtices of Peace, the Number whereof is as His Majeſty thinks fit, there are ſome particularly called <hi>Juſtices of the Quorum,</hi> from theſe Words in the Commiſſion, <hi>Quorum
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49236:373"/>A.B. unum eſſe volumus.</hi> As for Example, Where a Commiſſion is directed to ſeven Perſons, or any three of them <hi>Whereof</hi> A.B. and C.D. to be two, theſe are ſaid to be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> becauſe the reſt cannot proceed without them. So that a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace and Quorum</hi> is one without whom the reſt of the Juſtices in ſome Caſes cannot proceed.</p>
                     <p>Every Quarter, or three Months, the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of each County meet at the chief (or Shire) Town; from whence this Court came to be called the <hi>Quarter Seſſions.</hi> Where the Grand Inqueſt (or Jury) of the County is ſummoned to appear; who upon Oath are to inquire of Malefactors, Rioters, and ſuſpected Perſons.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>G and Jury</hi> do's commonly conſiſt of 24 grave and ſubſtantial Gentlemen, or ſome of the better ſort or Yeomen, choſen indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently (or at leaſt ought ſo to be) by the Sheriff out of the whole Shire, to conſider of all Bills of Inditement preferred to the Court. Which Bills they do either approve by Writing upon them <hi>Billa Vera,</hi> or diſallow by indorſing <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Preſently upon the Allowance of a Bill, the Party concerned is ſaid to be Indited, and is committed to Priſon. But what Bills are Diſallowed are delivered to the Bench, by whom they are forthwith cancelled or torn. If the approved Bills touch Life and Death, they are further referred to another Jury to be conſidered of, becauſe the Caſe is of ſuch Importance; but others of lighter moment are proceeded upon by fining the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, without any more ado. Unleſs the Party traverſe the Inditement, or challenge it for Inſufficiency, or remove the Cauſe to a higher Court by <hi>Certiorari;</hi> in which two former Caſes it is referred to another Jury, and in the latter tranſmitted to a higher
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49236:373"/>Court. In ſhort, the Trial is uſually referred to the next Aſſizes, when the Judges at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter go their Circuits.</p>
                     <p>Originally this Court ſeems to have been erected only for Matters touching the Peace, but now it extends much further. The She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, or his Under-Sheriff, is bound to attend upon this Court, with his Conſtables, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo in every County commonly four Officers, called <hi>Coroners</hi> (vulgarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Crowners</hi>) becauſe they deal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with Pleas of the Crown, or Matters concerning the Crown. His Office is to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by a Jury of Neighbours how and by whom any Perſon came by a violent Death, and to enter the ſame upon Record. And, whereas the Sheriff in his Turn may inquire of all Felonies by the Common Law, except a Mans Death; the Coroner can inquire of no Felony but of the Death of Man, and that <hi>ſuper viſum Corporis,</hi> upon view of the Body. Which Inquiſition of Death taken by him he ought to deliver at the next Goal-Delivery, or certify the ſame into the Kings Bench. Therefore he ought to put in writing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are, as I ſaid before, commonly four of theſe Officers in every County of England. But <hi>Cheſhire</hi> has but two, and each Shire in Wales has no more.</p>
                     <p>The ſame are choſen by the Freeholders of the County, by virtue of a Writ out of the Chancery; and continue, notwithſtanding the Demiſe of the King, in their Office. Which was of old in ſo great eſteem, that none could have it under the degree of a Knight. And, by the Writ <hi>De Coronatore eligendo,</hi> the Party to be choſen muſt have ſufficient Knowledge and Ability to execute this Office; which is implied in theſe Words, <hi>Et talem eligi facias qui melius ſciat &amp; poſſit Officio illi intendere.</hi> After he is elected, the Sheriff is to take his Oath, only to execute his Office. And the Court which he holdeth is a Court of Record.</p>
                     <p>Every County alſo has an Officer called <hi>Clerk of the Market.</hi> Whoſe Office is to keep a Standard of all Weights and Meaſures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Kings Standard kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The vileſt ſort of <hi>Bayliffs</hi> to this day are thoſe Officers that ſerve Writs, and Arreſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by virtue thereof. And theſe are of two Sorts, <hi>Bayliffs Errants,</hi> and <hi>Bayliffs of Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> The firſt are ſuch as the Sheriff makes and appoints to go any where in the County to ſerve Writs, to ſummon the County, Seſſions, Aſſizes, and ſuch like. <hi>Bayliffs of Franchiſes</hi> be thoſe that are appointed by every Lord of a Mannor, to do ſuch Offices within his Liberty as the Bayliff Errant doth at large in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Stewards,</hi> I mean here ſuch as are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by ſome Lords of Mannors to hold their Courts, called <hi>Court-Leet,</hi> or <hi>View of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledge;</hi> the word <hi>Leet</hi> ſignifying properly a Law-Day.</p>
                     <p>This is a Court of Record, not incident to every Mannor; but to thoſe only which by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grant, or long Preſcription, hold the ſame. For 'tis likely Kings did not intruſt any with this Power, but ſuch as they had great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for and Confidence in. To this Court thoſe that are within the Homage, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe out of it, are called to Swear Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Prince. Here alſo Inquiry is made of Privy Conſpiracies, Frays, Bloodſhed, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49236:376"/>Murders. To which was added the Overſight of Meaſures. And what Offences are found, eſpecially great ones, ought to be Certified to the Juſtices of Aſſize, by a Statute made in the Reign of Edward III. For in whoſe Mannor ſoever this Court be Kept, it is accounted the King's Court, becauſe the Authority thereof originally belongs to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, this Court (firſt derived from the Sheriffs Turn) is ordinarily Kept but twice a Year, and that at certain times.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Court incident to every Mannor, called <hi>Court-Baron,</hi> becauſe in ancient times every Lord of a Mannor was ſtiled Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
                     <p>To this Court are all the Tenants Summoned that belong to the Mannor; where part of the Tenants being Sworn, make a Jury, which is not called the Inqueſt, but the Homage. Here the Steward ſits as Judge, and directs the Jury to enquire of ſuch Things as are proper for this Court. And theſe principally Inquire of Copy-holders and Free-holders that be dead ſince the laſt Court, and bring in their Heirs and next Succeſſors. They likewiſe Inquire of any Incroachment or Intruſion of Tenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, or among themſelves. They alſo make Orders and Laws amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a Penalty annexed for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors payable to the Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, theſe Courts are of great Uſe for Men that are willing to be ordered by their Neighbours, and who prefer their Quiet and Advantage in Husbandry to the Trouble and Charges of Law-Suits. Otherwiſe either Party
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49236:376"/>may procure a Writ out of a higher Court, to remove the Plea to Weſtminſter.</p>
                     <p>Courts-Baron may be held every three Weeks, or at any longer time, according to the Lords pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>I conclude with <hi>Conſtables,</hi> called in ſome Places <hi>Headboroughs,</hi> and in others <hi>Tithing-men,</hi> whoſe Office is only Miniſterial. Theſe Men, ſays <hi>Sir Thomas Smith,</hi> were formerly called <hi>Cuſtodes Pacis,</hi> or Guardians of the Peace, and were in much greater eſteem than they be now, whoſe Power and Authority he ſuppoſes to have been equal with that of the preſent Juſtices of Peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lambert</hi> looks upon this Office as a Stream of that great Dignity lodged in the Lord High Conſtable of England. Out of this high Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, ſays he, were drawn thoſe lower <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,</hi> which we call <hi>Conſtables of Hundreds and Franchiſes.</hi> Firſt ordained by the Statute of Wincheſter, 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> I. which appoints for the Conſervation of the Peace, and view of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, two Conſtables in every Hundred and Franchiſe, called in Latine <hi>Conſtabularii Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> in Engliſh, High Conſtables. And, by reaſon of the Increaſe both of People and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, others were made in proceſs of time, called <hi>Petty Conſtables,</hi> which are of like Nature, but of inferiour Authority to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Office of a Conſtable is properly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch as break the Peace, and common Malefactors, and even Perſons ſuſpected of any Crime, upon a Charge given them, or a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it from a Juſtice. For a Badge of his Authority, he carries a long Staff painted, with the King's Arms; and, for a Surpriſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49236:377"/>he uſes a ſhort Staff, which he hides till he thinks it convenient to produce it. The Party apprehended he keeps in his Cuſtody, till he can bring him before a Juſtice of Peace; who, upon a ſtrict Examination of the Fact, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Evidence, commits the Party to Priſon, if he ſees cauſe, in order to his Trial. Upon which the Conſtable conducts him to Priſon, and there delivers him to the Goalers Cuſtody, with the <hi>Committimus</hi> directed by the Juſtice of Peace to the Jayler. And the Party muſtly in Priſon, till the Juſtices of Peace do meet either at their Quarter-Seſſions, or at their Goal-Delivery, when the Priſoners are by Law either condemned, or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed.</p>
                     <p>When he is upon Duty, and about to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend one, he may call his Neighbours to aid; and whoever declines to give him aſſiſtance, is liable by Law to Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of Theft, Robbery, or Murder, in a Country Town or Village, and the Malefactor be upon flight, the Conſtable having notice of it, is to raiſe the Pariſh in purſuit of him. And this is called <hi>Hue and Cry.</hi> If the Malefactor be not found in the Pariſh, the Conſtable and his Aſſiſtants are to go to the next, to get the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> raiſed there by the Conſtable of it. In this manner the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> is carried from Pariſh to Pariſh, till the Criminal be found. And that Pariſh which does not do its Duty, but gives way by its Negligence for the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors Eſcape, is not only to pay a Fine to the King, but muſt repay to the Party robbed his Damages.</p>
                     <p>When the Malefactor is taken, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carried by the Conſtable, or any other by whom he was apprehended, to a Juſtice of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49236:377"/>Peace. Who examines the Malefactor, writes the Examination, and (if he do confeſs) his Confeſſion. Then he binds the Party robbed, or him that ſueth, together with the Conſtable, and ſo many as can give Evidence againſt the Malefactor, to appear at the next Seſſions of Goal-Delivery, there to give their Evidence for the King. He binds them in a Recognizance of 10. 20. 30. 40. or 100. <abbr>l.</abbr> more or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Diſcretion and the quality of the Crime. Which, being certified under his hand, fails not to be levied upon Recognizance, if they fail of being there.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> which formerly had much the ſame Authority as our modern Juſtices of Peace, are now ſubſervient to them upon all Occaſions, either to bring the Criminals before them, or to carry them by their Command to the common Priſon. And accordingly this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice does commonly fall into the hands of Tradeſmen and Artificers, and Men of ſmall experience and ability; who hold it for a Year, there being commonly two of them to each Pariſh, choſen by the Veſtry. But the hardeſt part of their Office in London, eſpecially is their Watching a Nights, and walking the Rounds in their ſeveral Pariſhes. But then they have the chief Command of the Watch; and becauſe ſeldom a greater Power appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad at that time, therefore a Conſtable came to be called the <hi>King of the Night.</hi>

The Times of the Year fixt for it are preſently after the end of Hilary-Term, and after the end of Trinity Term; that being called the <hi>Lent,</hi> and this the Summer <hi>Aſſizes.</hi> In relation to which, England is divided into Six Parts, called <hi>Circuits.</hi> Viz.
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Home-Circuit,</hi> Comprehending Eſſex, Hartford, Suſſex, Surrey, Kent.</item>

                           <item>3. <hi>Midland Circuit,</hi> Comprehending Warwick, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Derby, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Lincoln, Rutland, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton.</item>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49236:378"/>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the two <hi>Circuits</hi> for <hi>Wales,</hi> viz. North and South Wales, for each of which two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants at Law are appointed.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Courts are called <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> and the Judges thereof <hi>Juſtices of Aſſize,</hi> from their Commiſſion of <hi>Aſſize;</hi> by vertue whereof they are to do Right upon Writs called <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> and brought before them by ſuch as are (or pretend to be) wrongfully thruſt out of their Lands. The Writs ſo called, 1. Becauſe they ſettle the Poſſeſſion, and ſo an outward Right in him that obtaineth by them. 2. Becauſe they were originally executed at a certain Time and Place formerly appointed. 3. For that they are tried commonly by ſpecial Courts appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides this Commiſſion, there are four others, by which theſe Itinerant Judges admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Juſtice in the Country. As, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to take Niſi-prius,</hi> directed to none
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49236:379"/>but the Judges themſelves, and their Clerks of Aſſizes, by which they are called <hi>Juſtices of Niſi prius.</hi> Which is a common Adjournment of a Cauſe in the Common Pleas, to put it off to ſuch a Day, <hi>Niſi prius Juſticiarii venerint ad eas Partes ad capiendas Aſſiſas,</hi> from which Words <hi>Niſi prius</hi> the Writ came to be called a Writ of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> the Juſtices, <hi>Juſtices of Niſi prius,</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtices of Aſſize.</hi> Yet there is this Difference, that as <hi>Juſtices of Aſſize,</hi> they have Power to give Judgement in a Cauſe, whereas <hi>Juſtices of Niſi prius</hi> take only the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Beſides that thoſe in a ſtrict ſenſe, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle only with the poſſeſſory Writs called Aſſize; but theſe do deal in Cauſes both real and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                     <p>Another is a <hi>Commiſſion of Peace,</hi> in every County of the Circuit.</p>
                     <p>But the largeſt <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of all is That of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> directed to the Judges, and many others of the beſt account in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits; but in this Commiſſion, the Judges of Aſſize are of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> ſo as without them there can be no Proceedings. This Commiſſion gives them Power to judge of Treaſons, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all manner of Felonies and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, they have a <hi>Commiſſion of Goal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> directed only to themſelves, and the Clerk of the Aſſize aſſociate. By which Commiſſion they are to deal with every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in Goal, for what Offence ſoever he be there.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Courts are uſually held at the principal Town of every County, with great pomp, ſplendour, and feaſting, two Judges being appointed for every Circuit. Then the Sheriff of the County is bound to attend in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49236:379"/>perſon, with his Under-Officers, the Clerks, Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of Courts, Bayliffs of Hundreds, Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Jaylors, Sergeants or Beadles, and a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Train of Servants in rich Liveries, all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Horſeback at the Reception of the Judges; whom they wait on and guard, ſo long as they continue in the County. If the Sheriff cannot come himſelf, he muſt depute one to fill up his Place; who is to be allowed by the Judges. The Juſtices of Peace are alſo to wait on the Judges. And, if either the Sheriff, or they fail in this part of their Duty, without lawful Impediment, the Judges may ſet a Fine upon him or them, at their pleaſure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions.</p>
                     <p>The Diſpatch of theſe Itinerant Judges in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in their ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits is worthy our Obſervation. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in each County all Controverſies grown to Iſſue in the Courts at London, are commonly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined here in two or three Days. Which is done, not as in forein Countries, by the ſole Arbitrement of the Judges, but by a <hi>Jury of Twelve Men</hi> in each County, choſen by the Sheriff thereof, and only directed in point of Law by the Judges. For every Trial by Aſſize (be the Action civil or criminal, publick or private, perſonal or real) is referred for the Fact to a Jury, as it is in moſt Courts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; and, as they find it, ſo paſſeth the Judgement.</p>
                     <p>The Way of Trying Criminals in England being ſomething ſingular and different from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, it will not be improper (after that excellent and moſt ingenious Author, Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>) to ſhew the Manner of it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49236:380"/>were it but for the ſatisfaction of Forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>How Criminals are taken into Cuſtody in order to their Trial, and how the ſame are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited at the Quarter-Seſſions, I have already ſhewed. The Inditement is no definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but only <hi>Praejudicium,</hi> or the Opinion the Country has of the Malefactors Caſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men are often Indited in their abſence. But no Man once Indicted can be delivered without an Arraignment; for as a Jury of Twelve Men have given a Prejudice againſt him, ſo Twelve again muſt acquit or condemn him.</p>
                     <p>At the Aſſizes the Judges ſit either in the Town-houſe, or in an open Place, where a Tribunal is ſet up for Judgement The Judges ſit in the middle, the principal Juſtices of Peace on each ſide of them according to their Degree, and the reſt on a lower Bench before the Judges Seat. Something lower a Table is ſet before them, at which the <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum</hi> or Keeper of Writs, the Under-Sheriff, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheater, and the Clerks do ſit. Near the Table there is a Bar for the Jury to come in, when they are called; and behind that ſpace another Bar for the Priſoners to ſtand at, who are brought thither in Chains.</p>
                     <p>Then the Cryer crieth, and commandeth Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. One of the Judges makes a ſhort Speech, wherein he declares (amongſt other Things) the cauſe of their coming. His Speech is no ſooner ended, but the Priſoners are called in by Name, and every one muſt anſwer to his Name. Then the Keeper of the Writs produces the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditements, and the Judges name one, or two, or three of the Priſoners Indited, to proceed upon their Trial.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49236:380"/>
                     <p>The Clerk bids one of them come to the Bar, and hold up his hand. Then he charges him with his Crime, to which he bids him anſwer <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Priſoner ſtands mute, and will not anſwer, after he has been once or twice ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated (which happens very ſeldom,) he is Judged Mute, or Dumb by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy; the Puniſhment whereof is to be Preſſed to Death, of which more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>If the Priſoner cries <hi>Guilty,</hi> (which is but ſeldom too) his Trial is over, and all the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to pronounce Sentence upon him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>
                     <p>But the common Anſwer is <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> though the Party be never ſo apparently Guilty, and his Anſwer be perhaps contrary to his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Fact before the Juſtice of Peace by whom he was examined and committed. The Reaſon is, becauſe he flatters himſelf, that he may chance to come off for want of right Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For the Law of England is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mens Lives, that unleſs the Evidences (which are upon their Oaths) be poſitive and clear againſt any Priſoner, he may come off.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Priſoner's pleading <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> the Clerk asketh him, whether he will be Tried by God and the Country. If he anſwer <hi>Yes,</hi> the Clerk tells him, he has been <hi>Indited</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> &amp;c. That he has pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi> to it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd that being asked how he would be Tried, he has anſwered <hi>by God and the Country.</hi> Then he tells him of the <hi>Jury</hi> preſent, that repreſent the Country; and, if he has ſomething to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt any of them, he bids him take a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49236:381"/>view of them, and ſpeak, for that he ſtands upon Life and Death.</p>
                     <p>Upon this the Jury is Sworn, conſiſting of 12 Men at leaſt. And, if the Priſoner be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Engliſhmen, and half of Foreiners. In caſe the Priſoner has no Exception to make againſt any of them, by that time Twelve are Sworn, theſe ſtand to give the Verdict. Whereupon the Crier ſays aloud, <hi>If any one can give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or can ſay any thing againſt the Priſoner, let him come now, for he ſtands upon his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> If none come in, the Judge doth ask who ſent him to Priſon. And, if the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace be preſent who did it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up the Examination he took of him, ſubſcribed by thoſe whom he has bound to give Evidence; who, for not appearing, muſt pay their Recognizance. In the mean time the Jury acquit the Priſoner, tho he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Crime to the Juſtice of Peace.</p>
                     <p>But, if they come in that are bound to give Evidence, firſt the Juſtices Examination is read; and then the Party robbed (being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) is ſworn, next to him the Conſtable and ſuch as were with him at the taking of the Priſoner, and at laſt as many more as are there to give Evidence. Who are all ſet in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to ſee the Judges and Juſtices, the Jury, and the Priſoner, ſo as to hear them, and to be heard of them all.</p>
                     <p>The Judge, after they be ſworn, asketh firſt the Party robbed, if he know the Priſoner, and bids him look upon him. The Party rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſays Yes, and upon that relates the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, with all its Circumſtances.

By vertue whereof one in Orders ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned of Felony by a Secular Judge, might pray his Clergy, which was as much as if he prayed to be delivered to his Ordinary, to purge himſelf of the Offence objected. But
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49236:382"/>the ancient Courſe of the Law in this point of Clergy is much altered, ſo that Lay-men have been made capable of this Benefit in many Caſes; As in Theft of Oxen, Sheep, Mony, and other Things, not forcibly taken to the terrour of the Owner. So favourable is our Law, that for the firſt Fault the Felon ſhall be admitted to his Clergy. In order to which the Biſhop ſends a Clergy-man, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under his Seal, to be Judge in that matter at every Goal-Delivery. If the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner demands to be admitted to his Book, the Judge commonly gives him a Pſalter, and turns to what place he pleaſes.

                     <p>FROM the Church Legiſlative, I come to the Executive Power, for which there have been ſeveral Courts provided. Amongſt which is the <hi>Court of Arches,</hi> the chief and moſt ancient Conſiſtory that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury, for the debating of Spiritual Cauſes. So called from the arched Church and Tower of <hi>S. Mary le Bow</hi> in Cheapſide London, where this Court is wont to be held. The Judge whereof is called <hi>Dean of the Arches,</hi> or the <hi>Official</hi> of the Court of Arches, becauſe with this Officialty is commonly joyned a peculiar Juriſdiction of 13 Pariſhes in London, termed a Deanry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempt from the Biſhop of Londons Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and belonging to the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury. All Appeals in Church-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within the Province of Canterbury are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this Court. In which the Judge ſits alone without Aſſeſſors, hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining all Cauſes without any Jury.</p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49236:388"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Advocates</hi> allowed to plead in this Court are all to be Doctors of the Civil Law. Who, upon their Petition to the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury, and his <hi>Fiat</hi> obtained, are admitted by the Judge of this Court, but muſt not practiſe the firſt Year.</p>
                     <p>Both the Judge and the Advocates always wear their Scarlet Robes, with Hoods lined with Taffety if they be of Oxford, or white Minever Furr if of Cambridge, and all round black Velvet Caps.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the Advocates, here are alſo ten <hi>Proctors,</hi> to manage other Mens Cauſes. Who wear Hoods lined with Lambs-Skin, if not Graduates; but if Graduates, Hoods proper to the Degree.</p>
                     <p>According to the Statutes of this Court, all Arguments made by Advocates, and Petitions by the Proctors, are to be made in Latine. All Proceſs of this Court runs in the Name of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>To this Court belong two principal Officers that attend it. Viz. an <hi>Actuary,</hi> who ſets down the Judges Decrees, regiſters the Court Acts, and ſends them in Books to the Regiſtry.</p>
                     <p>Then a <hi>Regiſter,</hi> whoſe Office is by himſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Next to which is the <hi>Beadle,</hi> an inferiour Officer, who carries a Mace before the Judge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Audience Court</hi> is a Court of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Arches, tho inferiour both in Antiquity and Dignity. The Original of this Court was thus. The Arch-Biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury heard many Cauſes extrajudicially at home in his own Pallace; but, before he would finally determine any thing, he did uſually commit them to be diſcuſſed by certain Men learned in the Civil and Canon Laws, who thereupon were called his Auditors, till at laſt thoſe Cauſes were committed to One, thence named <hi>Cauſarum Negotiorumque Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae Cantuarienſis Auditor ſeu Officialis.</hi> And with this Office was joyned heretofore the Arch-Biſhops Chancery, which properly meddles not with any point of contentious Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or deciding of Cauſes between Party and Party, but only of Office; as the Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cuſtody of the Spiritualities during the Vacation of Biſhopricks, Inſtitution to Benefices, Diſpenſing with Banes of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, &amp;c. But this is now diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Audience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prerogative Court</hi> is the Court wherein all Wills are proved, and all Adminiſtrations taken, that belong to the Arch Biſhop by his Prerogative; that is, where the Deceaſed had Goods of any conſiderable value out of the Dioceſe wherein he died. And that Value is uſually 5 <abbr>l.</abbr> except it be otherwiſe by Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between the Arch-Biſhop and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as in the Dioceſe of London, where it is 10 <abbr>l.</abbr> If any Contention ariſe between Two or more touching any ſuch Will or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, the Cauſe is properly debated and decided in this Court. The Judge whereof is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49236:389"/>termed <hi>Judex Curiae Praerogativae Cantuarienſis,</hi> the Judge of the Prerogative Court of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</p>
                     <p>Who is attended in the Court by a <hi>Regiſter,</hi> or his Deputy, whoſe Office is to ſet down the Decrees and Acts of the Court, to Keep the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, all Original Wills and Teſtaments of Parties deceaſed that have left <hi>Bona Not abilia,</hi> &amp;c. His Office is commonly called the <hi>Prerogative Office,</hi> now Kept in the Deans Court near St. Paul's Church-yard; where, for a moderate Fee, one may have a Copy of any ſuch Teſtament. And Under the Regiſter are Six <hi>Clerks,</hi> ſeverally appointed for ſuch and ſuch Counties.</p>
                     <p>This Court, formerly held in the Conſiſtory of St. Pauls, is now Kept in the Common-Hall at Drs. Commons, next Day after the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in the Afternoon.</p>
                     <p>All Places belonging to this Court are in his Grace's Gift.</p>
                     <p>The Archbiſhop of York has alſo the like Court, which is termed his <hi>Exchequer,</hi> but far inferiour to this in Power and Profit. He has alſo an Audience Court.</p>
                     <p>For Civil Affairs that concern the Church, the higheſt Court is the <hi>Court of Delegates.</hi> A Court which conſiſts of Commiſſioners delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or appointed by the King's Commiſſion, to ſit upon an Appeal to Him in the Court of Chancery, and is granted in three Caſes. Firſt, when a Sentence is given in any Eccleſiaſtical Cauſe by the Archbiſhop, or his Official. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when any Sentence is given in any Eccleſiaſtical Cauſe in Places exempt. Thirdly, when Sentence is given in the Admiralty in Suits Civil and Marine, by order of the Civil Law.</p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49236:390"/>
                     <p>The Judges are appointed by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, under the Great Seal of England, <hi>pro illa vice;</hi> and upon every Cauſe or Buſineſs there is a new Commiſſion, and new Judges, according to the nature of the Cauſe. As ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Biſhops, Common-Law Judges, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Knights, and Civilians; ſometimes Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Civilians; at other times Common Law Judges, and Civilians; and ſometimes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians only.</p>
                     <p>This Court is Kept in the ſame Place as the former, the next Day after the Prerogative-Court in the Afternoon. Here the Citations and Decrees run in the King's Name, and to this Court belongs a ſtanding <hi>Regiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this Court lies no Appeal in common Courſe. But the King may (and ſometimes does) grant a Commiſſion of Review, under the Great Seal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court of Peculiars</hi> is about certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes that have Juriſdiction within themſelves for Probate of Wills, &amp;c. being exempt from the Ordinary, and the Biſhops Courts. 'Tis an ancient Priviledge of the See of Canterbury, that whereſoever any Mannors or Advowſons do belong to it, they forthwith become exempt from the Ordinary, and are reputed <hi>Peculiars.</hi> And there are reckoned in his Province no leſs than 57 ſuch Peculiars. So the King's Chappel is a <hi>Royal Peculiar,</hi> exempt from all Spiritual Juriſdiction, and reſerved to the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and immediate Government of the King himſelf, who is ſupreme Ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe Courts ſerving for the whole Province, every Biſhop has his Court held in the Cathedral of his Dioceſe. Over which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49236:390"/>he hath a <hi>Chancellour,</hi> anciently termed the Church-Lawyer, who being skilled in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Canon Law, ſits there as Judge. But, if his Dioceſe be large, he has in ſome more remote Place a <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> whoſe Authority is only in ſome certain Places of the Dioceſe, and certain Cauſes limited to him by the Biſhop in his Commiſſion. Theſe are called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory Courts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every Arch-Deacon beſides has his <hi>Court</hi> and Juriſdiction, where ſmaller Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing within his Limits are pleaded. The Dean and Chapter of every Cathedral or Collegiate Church have alſo a <hi>Court,</hi> wherein they take Cognizance of Cauſes happening in Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Cathedral.</p>
                     <p>The proper Matters belonging to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts are Ordinations, Inſtitution of Clerks to Benefices, Celebration of Divine Service, Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, Mortuaries, Dilapidations, Reparation of Churches. Rights of Matrimony, Divorces, general Baſtardy, Probate of Wills, Adminiſtrations, Penſions, Procurations, Commutation of Penance, &amp;c. the Cognizance whereof does not belong to the Common Law. Alſo Apoſtacy from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Simony, Hereſy, Schiſms, Blaſphemy, Fornication, Inceſts, Adulteries.</p>
                     <p>The Manner of Trials here is different from thoſe at Common Law, as thus. Firſt goes forth a <hi>Citation,</hi> then a <hi>Bill and Anſwer,</hi> after that they proceed to <hi>Proofs, Witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> the Matter being argued <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Civil Laws</hi> quoted. Upon which the definitive <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Judge
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49236:391"/>paſſeth without any Jury, and then <hi>Execution.</hi> follows.</p>
                     <p>And for Criminal Cauſes, they are here tried by <hi>Accuſation,</hi> as when one takes upon him to prove the Crime. Or by <hi>Denunciation,</hi> when the Church-Wardens preſent, and are not bound to prove, becauſe it is preſumed they do it without malice, and that the Crime is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE City of London is, amongſt other Things, ſo remarkable for her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Priviledges in Keeping her own Courts of Juſtice, that it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to deſcribe 'em here.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the <hi>Lord Mayor's Court,</hi> which is a Court of Record, held in the Chamber of Guildhall. The Recorder of the City is Judge of this Court; but the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may ſit as Judges with him, if they pleaſe. In this Court all manner of Actions may be entred and tried by a Jury, as in other Courts,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49236:391"/>for any Debt, Treſpaſs, or other Matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ariſing within the Liberties of London, and to any value. There are only four Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys belonging to it; and ſix Serjeants at Mace, one of them conſtantly attending at the Lord Mayor's Houſe, and the reſt at the Attorneys Offices.</p>
                     <p>The Charge of entring an Action in this Court is but 4 <abbr>d.</abbr> beſides the King's Duty. It may be brought to a Trial for 30 <abbr>s.</abbr> Charge, and in 14 Days time; the Day for Trials being every Tueſday. An Action entred in this Court will remain in force for ever; although no Proceedings; be had thereupon. Whereas an Action entred at either of the Compters dies, and may be croſſed after 16 Weeks.</p>
                     <p>The Advantages of making Attachments in this Court are conſiderable, as you may ſee in the Book called <hi>Lex Londinenſis,</hi> or the City Law.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court of Aldermen</hi> is a Court of Record, held in the Inner Chamber of Guildhall every Tueſday and Thurſday, except Holy-days, and in the Time of Seſſions of Goal-Delivery. This Court does conſtantly appoint the Aſſize of Bread, determines all Matters touching Lights, Water-courſes, and Party-Walls, and here muſt be ſealed all Bonds and Leaſes that paſs under the City-Seal.</p>
                     <p>Several Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor and this Court. Viz. The Recorder, Sword-bearer, Four City Counſel, a City Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, the Common Hunt. Water-Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, Cities Sollicitor, Comptroller of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, two Secondaries, Four Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court, Clerk of the Chamber, Hall-Keeper, Three Sergeant Carvers, Three
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49236:392"/>Sergeants of the Chamber, Sergeant of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, Yeomen of the Chamber, Four Yeomen of the Water-ſide, Yeoman of the Channel, Under Water-Bayliff, Meal-Weighers, Clerk of the Cities Works, Six Young-men, Two Clerks of the Papers, Eight Attorneys in the Sheriffs Court, Eight Clerk-ſitters, Two Protonotaries, Clerk of the Bridge-houſe, Clerk of the Court of Requeſts, Beadle of the Court of Requeſts, Thirty Six Sergeants at Mace, Thirty Six Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Gager, Sealers and Searchers of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Keeper of the Green-Yard, Two Keepers of the Compters, Keeper of Newgate, Keeper of Ludgate, Meaſurer, Steward of Southwark, Bayliff of Southwark, and Bayliff of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Oſſulſton.</p>
                     <p>There are other Places in the gift of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs; as the City-Carpenter, and other Artificers. But the Rent-Gatherer has been put in by Mr. Chamberlain.</p>
                     <p>If any Officer (ſays <hi>Lex Londinenſis</hi>) ſhall misbehave himſelf in his Office, upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made thereof to this Court, and Proof of the Fact, ſuch Offender may be, and is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuſpended from the Profits of his Place, during the pleaſure of this Court.</p>
                     <p>The Rulers of the Company of Watermen are annually elected and appointed by this Court.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court of Common Council</hi> conſiſts of two Orders, as the Parliament of England; viz. the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, which repreſent the Houſe of Lords, and the Common Council Men which repreſent the Houſe of Commons, whoſe Number amounts to 231, belonging to their reſpective Wards, whereof ſome have more, ſome leſs. This Court is held in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49236:392"/>Chamber of Guildhall, at ſuch Times as the Lord Mayor appoints and directs, being in his Lordſhips power to call and diſmiſs this Court at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Several Committees are annually appointed and elected by this Court for the better and more ſpeedy Diſpatch of the City-Affairs, who make Report to this Court of their Proceedings, as Occaſion requires. Viz. a Committee of 6 Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and 12 Commoners, for letting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the Cities Lands and Tenements; who uſually meet every Wedneſday in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at Guildhall for that purpoſe. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of 4 Aldermen, and 8 Commoners, to let and diſpoſe of the Lands and Tenements given by Sir Tho. Greſham, who uſually meet at Mercer's Hall, at ſuch Times as the Lord Mayor for the time being directs and appoints; and the Lord Mayor himſelf is commonly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen one of this Committee.</p>
                     <p>This Court does alſo annually elect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for the Sewers, and Pavements. And by this Court are annually elected a Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Aſſiſtants, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Cities Lands in Ulſter in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>A Stranger born may be made free of this City by Order of this Court, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The Places of Common Serjeant, Town-Clerk, and Common Crier, are in the Gift of this Court. The Judges of the Sheriffs Court have ſometimes been elected by this Court, and ſometimes by the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Huſtings</hi> is a very ancient Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, always held in Guildhall, and commonly every Tueſday, before the Lord Mayor and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49236:393"/>Sheriffs of London for the time being. When any Matter is to be argued or tried in this Court, Mr. Recorder ſits as Judge with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and gives Rules and Judgement therein. And, though the Original Writ be directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs joyntly, yet theſe by Commandment of the Lord Mayor, are Miniſters to execute all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs out of this Court.</p>
                     <p>In this Court Deeds may be Inrolled, Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries paſſed, Wills proved; and Replevins, Writs of Error, Right, Patent, Waſte, Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Dower may be determined for any Matters within the City of London, and the Liberties thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court are Attorneys alſo in this Court; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Attorney is always Clerk of the Inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Inrolls all Deeds brought for that purpoſe. Now a Deed Inrolled in the <hi>Huſtings</hi> is counted as good as a Fine at Common Law; for that it bars the Wife from claiming her Dower.</p>
                     <p>In this Court alſo the Burgeſſes to ſerve for the City in Parliament are elected by the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men of the reſpective Companies, which is done after this manner, in the preſence of the Court. Firſt, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are put up (according to ancient Cuſtom) for Candidates, and after them are uſually nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted four Commoners. And out of them all, the four that have the plurality of Voices are declared by the Sheriffs to be duly choſen. But, if there be any Conteſt about the Election, it is uſually decided by a Poll.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court of Goal Delivery</hi> is uſually held 8 times a Year at the Old-Baily, both for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49236:393"/>of London and County of Middleſex, for the Trial of Criminals. The Lord Mayor is the chief Judge of this Court, aſſiſted by ſome of the Judges, beſides the Recorder, and the two Sheriffs. He has the Power of Reprieving condemned Perſons.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Two Sheriffs Courts</hi> are held in Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, the one by one Sheriff, every Wedneſday and Friday, for Actions entred at the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet Compter, the other by the other Sheriff, every Thurſday and Saturday, for Actions entred at the Poultry Compter.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Courts belong 8 Attorneys, whoſe Buſineſs here is not to keep any Record, but only to aſſiſt their Clients, and take their Fees due to them in every Cauſe. Two Secondaries, who allow and return all Writs brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Cauſes out of theſe Courts. Two Clerks of the Papers, whoſe buſineſs is to draw the Subpoenas for Witneſſes to appear, and to file and copy all Declarations upon Actions in theſe Courts. Two Protonotaries, who draw and ingroſs all ſuch Declarations. Eight Clerk-ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who enter Actions and Attachments, and take Bails and Verdicts.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Courts may be tried Actions of Debt, Caſe, Treſpaſs, Accompt and Covenants broken, Attachments, and Sequeſtrations. And, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party ſhall have a Witneſs that cannot ſtay in London till the Day of Trial, his Teſtimony may be taken in writing, which will be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as good Evidence.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Chamberlain's Court,</hi> or <hi>Office,</hi> 'tis Kept in the Chamber of Guildhall. As he is intruſted with the Cities Caſh, and the Orphans Mony, ſo when he takes this Office upon him,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49236:394"/>he muſt give good Security to the Court of Aldermen; and he is accountable to Auditors appointed and choſen for that purpoſe. To him belongs the Buſineſs of Apprentices, over whom he has a great Authority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attends at Guildhall uſually every Forenoon, to Inroll and turn over Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, and to make ſuch Free as have duly ſerved the full Term of 7 Years, and have not married nor taken Wages in that Time.</p>
                     <p>When any Difference happens betwixt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and his Apprentice, the moſt prudential Way is to refer the matter before the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, who will freely hear both Parties, and decide the Controverſy for 3 Shill. Charge, viz. 1 Shill. to the Officer for the Summons, and 2 Shill. to the Clerk for the Order. Whereas, if they proceed at Law for Relief, it may coſt both Parties five or ſix pounds in Charges; and the Concluſion may be leſs ſatisfactory, than if decided by ſuch Reference as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>If an Apprentice ſhall be unruly or diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Maſter's Houſe, or commit any noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fault, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint made thereof) will ſend one of his Officers for ſuch Apprentice, and ſend him to Bridewell, or puniſh him otherwiſe, according to the nature of the Offence.</p>
                     <p>And, if any Maſter ſhall miſuſe his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, by beating him unreaſonably, or with unlawful Weapons, or by neglecting to inſtruct him, or to find him Neceſſaries, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint thereof made) will ſend a Summons for the Maſter to appear before him; and upon hearing both Parties, will relieve the Apprentice, or leave him to

                     <p>But, that you may Know more fully how this great Concern of the Orphans is managed for their benefit, and what Care is taken of their Welfare, I ſhall make bold to inlarge a little upon this Subject, out of <hi>Lex Londinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Freeman of London dies, leaving Children under Age, the Clerks of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pariſhes within the Bill of Mortality ought to give the Name of ſuch Freeman to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crier of the City. Who is thereupon to ſummon the Widow or Executor of ſuch Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to appear before the Court of Aldermen, there to be bound to bring in an Inventory of the Teſtator's Eſtate, within the ſpace of two Months. And, that the Inventory may be given in due time, the Court of Aldermen have made an Order, not to allow any finding Mony (or Intereſt) for any Mony that ſhall be paid into the Chamber of London by any Executor or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator belonging to any Freemans Eſtate, until ſuch time as the Executor or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator do bring in and exhibit upon Oath a true and perfect Inventory to the beſt of his Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>If the Party ſummoned do not appear, the Lord Mayor ſends his Warrant, and forces an Appearance. And, if any Executor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe to become bound to bring in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory, the Court of Aldermen have power to ſend him to Newgate, there to remain till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ſubmit; and the Courts at Weſtminſter will not releaſe ſuch Perſon.</p>
                     <p>After the Bond given, the Executor muſt procure 4 Freemen to appraiſe the Teſtator's Goods. In order to which he muſt cauſe them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49236:396"/>to appear before a Juſtice of Peace in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and take their Oaths, that they ſhall make a juſt and true Valuation and Appraiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goods and Chattels of the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according to the beſt of their Judgements and Skills.</p>
                     <p>When the Appraiſement is to be made, the Common Crier is to have notice of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, being appointed by the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſee the ſame be fairly done, and to the beſt advantage of the Orphan. And, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Common Crier, or his Deputy be preſent, and the Inventory ſigned by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crier, the Court of Aldermen will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Appraiſement being made as aforeſaid, and ſigned by the Common Crier and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſers, it muſt be given to the Common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant of the City, or one of his Clerks, at his Office in Guildhall-Yard; he being the only Perſon intruſted by the Court of Aldermen, to take all Inventories and Accounts of Freement Eſtates. If he approves thereof, he will cauſe it to be Ingroſſed, and a Duplicate of it to be made for the Executor or Adminiſtrator. And, when the ſame is examined by him, and his hand ſet thereto in teſtimony thereof, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor or Adminiſtrator muſt in the Court of Aldermen ſwear the ſame Inventory to be a true Inventory of the Goods and Chattels of the Party deceaſed, according to the beſt of his Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>When the Inventory is ſo exhibited, the Executor muſt become bound in a conſiderable Penalty, either to bring in the Mony that ſhall appear due to the Orphans by the Inventory, or within two Months to give good Security to pay the ſame into the Chamber of London for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49236:396"/>the Uſe of the Orphans, when they ſhall come to Age, or be married.</p>
                     <p>If the Executor pay the Mony into the Chamber of London, the Court of Aldermen uſually allow five <hi>per Cent</hi> Intereſt for ſo much Mony of the Teſtator's Eſtate as is due to the Orphans by the Cuſtom of London, ſo as the ſame exceed not 500 <abbr>
                           <hi>l;</hi>
                        </abbr> and for Legacy-mony, 3 <abbr>

                        </abbr> per Cent.</p>
                     <p>But, if the Executor ſhall not think fit to pay the Mony into the Chamber, he muſt become bound with 3 Sureties to the Chamberlain of London for the time being in one or more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances, or elſe by Bond to pay the Mony due to Orphans. And, in caſe the Security live within the Liberties of London, they muſt be bound by Bond.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to Recognizances, the Cuſtom is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make any touching Orphans of greater Penalty than 400 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> and not for the Payment of above 300. Therefore, if the Sum (for Example) be 900 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> the Security muſt become bound by 3 Recognizances, each for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 300 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Freeman leaves Lands and Tenements to his Children, the Executor muſt become bound with Sureties to account for the Rents and Profits thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Securities muſt take particular care that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urpoſe. And as the Orphan comes to be of the Age of 21 Years, or to be married with the Conſent of the Court of Aldermen, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities muſt take care to bring him to Guildhall, with a perſon to prove his Age. Then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan muſt acknowledge ſatisfaction for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49236:397"/>due to him, or her, of the Teſtator's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which muſt be done in the Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen. And, upon Motion made by Mr. Common Sergeant, the Court does order, that all Bonds entered into for the Payment of ſuch Orphan's Portion, ſhall be delivered up, and cancelled. And, if the Security became bound by Recognizances, the Clerk of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans will croſs and diſcharge ſuch Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Puniſhments inflicted on Malefactors.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the 9th Chapter of this Part I have ſhewn at large the Manner of Trying Criminals in England; wherein is to be commended our Engliſh Humanity towards Priſoners that are upon their Trial. When other Nations, under pretence that no Man ought to be put to Death but upon his own Confeſſion of the Crime he ſtands charged with, have deviſed ſuch <hi>racking Tortures</hi> to extort the Confeſſion, as make often the Innocent cry Guilty, and prefer Death to the Rack. But this I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready toucht upon in my firſt Part.</p>
                     <p>My Buſineſs is now to ſpeak of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted here upon Criminals of what nature ſoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hanging</hi> is the uſual Puniſhment to Death in England, either for High Treaſon, Petty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Felony. But the Manner is different.</p>
                     <p>For a Traytor to the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be drawn upon a Hurdle or Sledge to the Gallows, and there to be hanged by the Neck. But then he is preſently cut down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>live, his Entrals pulled out of his Belly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urnt before his Face, his Head cut off, and his Body divided into four Parts, and both the Head and Body hung up or impaled where the King ſhall command.</p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49236:401"/>
                     <p>This Puniſhment indeed, conſidering all its Circumſtances, ſeems cruel to ſuch as do not narrowly conſider the nature of the Crime. Whereas the Law thinks it but reaſonable, that whoſoever indeavours to cut off the King, or rend the Government, ſhould be himſelf cut off and rent, as before ſaid.</p>
                     <p>As for his Lands and Goods, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eited to the King; his Wife, if married, loſes her Dower; and, if he be Noble, his Children loſe their Right of Nobility, aſwell as Inheritance. For, by the Law, Treaſon taints the Bloud.</p>
                     <p>But it is obſervable, as to the Kings Perſon, that it is not only downright killing (or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering) the King which makes it High Treaſon. For the very imagining (or contriving) his Death, without any overt Act, is High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Falſifying and Clipping of Mony is alſo <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> by Law. But the Offender's Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only to be Drawn, and Hanged by the Neck, till he be dead.</p>
                     <p>The ſame it is with one guilty of <hi>Petty Treaſon,</hi> as when a Servant kills his Maſter or Miſtris, a Wife her Husband, or a Clergy-man his Prelate, to whom he ow's Obedience.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Felony,</hi> as Murder, Theft or Robbery, and other Capital Crimes, for which anciently there were ſeveral ſorts of Puniſhments, the Malefactor is but Hanged, ſince the Reign of Henry I.</p>
                     <p>But, when the Robbery is attended with Murder, the Criminal, after he is hanged and dead, is taken down to be hanged in Chains; and ſo to hang <hi>in terrorem</hi> till the Body be quite rotted off, or eaten up by the Birds of the Air.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49236:401"/>
                     <p>As to Perſons of great Birth and Quality, convicted of High Treaſon, Petty Treaſon, or Felony, tho the Judgment be the ſame with that of common Perſons, yet by the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they are uſually <hi>Beheaded.</hi> Which is performed with an Ax, upon a Block lying on the Scaffold; and not as in other Countries, by a Sword, kneeling or ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The Notion of Murder, as a Capital Crime, invites me to explain two Law-Terms relating to it, viz. <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> and <hi>Chance-medley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> is the unlawful killing of one without prepenſed Malice. As when two, that formerly meant no harm one to another, meet together; and falling out upon ſome ſudden Occaſion, the one kills the other. It differs from <hi>Murder,</hi> becauſe it is not done with fore-going Malice; and from <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medley,</hi> becauſe it has a preſent Intent to kill. 'Tis Felony, but it is allowed the Beneſit of the Clergy for the firſt time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chance-medley,</hi> otherwiſe called Manſlaughter by Miſadventure, ſignifies the caſual Killing of a Man, not altogether without the Killer's Fault, though without an evil Intent; for which the Offender ſhall have his Pardon of courſe. But here muſt be conſidered, whether the Offender, when he committed this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter by Chance-medley, was doing a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing. For, if the Act were unlawful, it is Felony. As if two are fighting together, and a third Man comes to part them, and is killed by one of the two, without any Malice fore-thought, or evil Intent in him that killed the Man, yet this is Murder in him, and not Manſlaughter by Chance-medley or Miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, becauſe they two that fought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were doing an unlawful Act. And, if
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49236:402"/>they were met with prepenſed Malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is Murder in them both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Burning alive</hi> is ſometimes uſed, but only for Witches, and Women convicted of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Petty Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>In the Time of Popery, eſpecially in the Reign of Queen Mary, this was the proper Puniſhment for Hereticks, that is, in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Senſe, for Proteſtants. When the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who ever delighted in humane Sacrifices, made Bonefires of them, and reſerved Hell-fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preſſing to Death,</hi> called by the Law <hi>Peine forte &amp; dure,</hi> is a Puniſhment for thoſe only that being Arraigned either of Petty Treaſon or Felony, refuſe to Anſwer, or to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the ordinary Trial of God and the Country. Which by the Law is called <hi>to ſtand Mute.</hi> And for this Contumacy the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is to be ſent back to the Priſon whence he came, there to be laid in ſome low dark Room, all naked but his privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground, his Arms and Legs ſtretched with Cords faſtened to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Quarters of the Room. Then is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Body Iron and Stone as much as he may bear, or more. The next Day he ſhall have three morſels of Barley-bread without Drink; and the Day after he ſhall have for his Drink as much of the next Water to the Priſon as he can drink three ſeveral times, except it be running Water, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bread. And this is to be his Diet, till he Die. Which grievous kind of Death ſome ſtout Men have choſen, to ſave their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49236:402"/>Eſtates to their Children, and keep their Bloud from being ſtained. But, in caſe of High Treaſon, though the Criminal ſtand mute, yet Judgment ſhall be given againſt him as if he had been Convicted, and his Eſtate ſhall be Confiſcated.</p>
                     <p>In many Parts beyond Sea the Criminals hanged or beheaded are denied <hi>Chriſtian Burial,</hi> their Society being declined in the Grave who were not fit to live in the World. In England, where they are charitably lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as reconciled to God upon their penitent Departure out of this World, their Friends are allowed to inter them decently where they think fit. He therefore that has Friends to look to his Burial go's to the Place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Coffin in the Cart with him, a good <hi>Memento Mori.</hi> And, after he has hanged about a quarter of an hour, he is cut down, laid in his Coffin, and conveyed in a Coach to the Place from whence he is deſigned to be buried. But <hi>Apoſtates, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,</hi> all <hi>perjured</hi> Perſons, and ſuch as die <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> alſo any one that is <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> or that has wittingly made himſelf away, all ſuch are by Law denied <hi>Chriſtian Burial.</hi> And ſo are for the moſt part Men that die for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> guilty of Murder.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Petty Larceny,</hi> or ſmall Theft, that is under the ancient value of 12 d. the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince Edward III. is by <hi>Whipping,</hi> and in the late Reigns has been often by Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Weſt-Indies, where they live for ſome Years a ſlaviſh Life. But, if the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſender be found by the Jury to have fled for the ſame, he forfeits all his Goods.</p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49236:403"/>
                     <p>For <hi>Miſpriſion of High-Treaſon,</hi> that is, for neglecting or concealing it, the Offender's Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is Forfeiture of the Profits of his Lands during Life, and of all his Goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Impriſonment for Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Perjury,</hi> whereby Mens Eſtates, Reputation, and Lives ly at ſtake, is commonly puniſhed only with the <hi>Pillory;</hi> never with Death, though it has coſt the Lives of many. 'Tis true a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer Convict is by Law incapable of being a Witneſs, or Adminiſtrator, or of bearing any publick Office. And, in the ſtrictneſs of the Law, he ought to be burnt in the forehead with a P, his Goods to be Confiſcated, and his Trees growing upon his Ground rooted up.</p>
                     <p>But all this is counted too little by thoſe Nations where wilful Perjury is puniſhed with Death. At leaſt it ſeems but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which is the Practice of Spain, that the Perjurer ſhould ſuffer the ſame Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he intended for another by his Perjury.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Forgery, Blaſphemy, Cheating, Libelling, Falſe Weights and Meaſures, Foreſtalling the Market, Offences in Baking and Brewing,</hi> are alſo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtanding in the <hi>Pillory.</hi> But ſometimes the Offender is Sentenced beſides to have one or both Ears nailed to the Pillory and cut off, or his Tongue there bored through with a hot Iron.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Striking in the Kings Court, ſo as to draw Bloud,</hi> the Criminal is to have his right Hand cut off in a moſt ſolemn manner. And for <hi>Striking in Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> whilſt the Courts of Juſtice are there ſitting, the Offender is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned during Life, and all his Eſtate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:49236:403"/>
                     <p>For one found in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that is, one who incurs the ſame Puniſhment which was inflicted on thoſe who tranſgreſſed the Statute of Rich. II. commonly called the <hi>Statute of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> (which Statute was properly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as avouched the Popes pretended Right of beſtowing by Proviſion moſt of the beſt Livings in England, by Mandates,) the Puniſhment is Forfeiture of all his Eſtate, to be put out of the King's Protection, and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned during the King's Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> and the like, who can give no good account of themſelves, are puniſhed by ſetting their Legs in the <hi>Stocks</hi> for certain hours. And <hi>Scolding Women</hi> (that are always teazing their Neighbours) by being ſet in a <hi>Cucking Stool</hi> placed over ſome deep Water and duck'd therein three ſeveral times, to cool their heat and choler.</p>
                     <p>Other <hi>Miſdemeanours</hi> are commonly puniſhed with <hi>Impriſonment</hi> or <hi>Fines,</hi> and ſometimes with both.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are the <hi>Corporal Puniſhments</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in England for Criminals that happen to fail into the hands of Juſtice. But there are alſo Spiritual Puniſhments, ſuch as concern the Soul eſpecially, and are in the power of the Spiritual Courts. 'Tis true they are but ſeldom put into practice, but let us ſee however what the Law is in this point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for refuſing to appear in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court upon Summons, or for not obeying the Orders of the Court, the Party Delinquent is admoniſhed. If he ſlight the Admonition, then comes upon him <hi>Minor Excommunicatio,</hi> the Leſſer Excommunication, whereby he is Excommunicated, or excluded from the Church;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49236:404"/>if not from the Church, at leaſt from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Lords Supper. And by this leſſer Excommunication, he is diſinabled to be Plaintiff in a Law-ſuit, &amp;c. Which Power of Excommunication the Biſhop may dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to any grave Prieſt with the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>But for Hereſy, Inceſt, Adultery, Perjury, and other grievous Crimes, <hi>Excommunicatio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> or the greater Excommunication, is uſed, and pronounced by the Biſhop himſelf in perſon. Now this is not only an Excluſion from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chriſtians in Spiritual Duties, but alſo in Temporal Concerns. For a Perſon ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated cannot in any Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Court be Plantiff, or Witneſs. And, if he continue 40 Days Excommunicated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledging and giving ſatisfaction for his Offence, the Chancery grants the King's Writ againſt him, <hi>De Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> to take him up and caſt him into Priſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bail; where he is to ly, till he has fully ſatisfied for his Offence.</p>
                     <p>Then comes the <hi>Anathema,</hi> but this is only inflicted upon an obſtinate Heretick. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is declared a publick Enemy of God, curſed, and delivered over to eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>one by the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Perſon, aſſiſted by the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or twelve other grave Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Delinquent is compelled to make a publick Confeſſion of his Fault, and to bewail it in the Church before the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Now this is called a <hi>publick Penance,</hi> and the Manner of it is thus. The Delinquent is to ſtand in the Church-porch upon a Sunday, bare-headed and bare-footed, in a white Sheet, and with a white Rod in his hand. Having
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49236:404"/>there bewailed himſelf, and begged every one that paſſes by to pray for him, he enters the Church, falling down, and Kiſſing the Ground. Then he is placed in the middle of the Church in a conſpicuous Place over againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Who makes a Diſcourſe upon the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Crime, and having received his humble Acknowledgement of the ſame, and his ſolemn Promiſe with God's help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to watch more carefully for the time to come againſt the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, pronounces in Chriſt's Name the Abſolution. The Penitent on his ſide humbly beſeeches the Congregation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and receive him into their holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and in teſtimony thereof to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe out of their Chriſtian Charity, to ſay with him aloud the Lord's Prayer. Which ſeems to be the Way uſed by the Primitive Churches.</p>
                     <p>But, when the Crime is not notorious and publick, the foreſaid Pennance may, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, be commuted (at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Requeſt) into a <hi>Pecuniary Mulct,</hi> for the Poor of the Pariſh, or ſome pious Uſes; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it may appear to be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Way for the Delinquents Reformation. Such is the Temper of ſome Men that, far from being likely to be reclaimed by a publication of their Offence, they will rather grow obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and impudent, when they perceive their Reputation to be loſt.</p>
                     <p>To all the foreſaid Puniſhments and Cenſures of the Church both the Laity and Clergy are ſubject. But there are other Puniſhments to which the faulty Clergy only are liable, which are four in Number; commonly called <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſio
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49236:405"/>ab Officio, Suſpenſio a Beneficio, Deprivatio a Beneficio,</hi> and <hi>Deprivatio ab Officio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, when a Miniſter for a time is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unfit to execute his Office. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> when he is for ſome time deprived of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his Benefice. Both which are wont to be for ſmaller Crimes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deprivatio a Beneficio,</hi> is when a Miniſter, for a greater Crime, is wholly, and for ever deprived of his Living. And the <hi>laſt</hi> is, when he is wholly and for ever deprived of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which is properly called in Engliſh a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, or Degradation.</p>
                     <p>This is commonly for ſome hainous, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crime. And then the Miniſter is ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtript by the Biſhop of his Prieſtly Veſtments in the preſence of the Civil Magiſtrate, to whom he is then delivered to be Puniſhed as a Lay-man for the like Offence.</p>

                           <p>'Tis called the Martial (or Military) Court, or High Court of Chivalry, otherwiſe the Court of Honour, and in Latine, <hi>Curia Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The Place anciently appointed for holding thereof was the <hi>King's Hall,</hi> wherein the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> and <hi>Earl Marſhal</hi> of England ſat as Judges. Where any Plaintiff, in caſe of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Matters of Arms, or of any other Sute or Controverſy concerning Nobility, Gentility, or Arms, might ſue the Defendant. But now, that great Office of Conſtable of England is hid aſide, the whole Power is veſted in the Earl Marſhal. And the Preſent Poſſeſſor of that honourable Office is his Grace <hi>Henry, Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marſhal of</hi> England. Who has appointed the Hall in the Colledge of Arms to be the Place for Keeping the ſaid Court. And, upon Application made to him by any of the Nobility or Gentry of this Kingdom, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in Matters of Honour and Arms, may there have relief from his Grace.</p>
